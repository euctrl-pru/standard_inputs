# Introduction {-}

This document provides a set of standard inputs for data commonly used in
economic and financial ATM-related analyses and appraisals.
The standard inputs will save time in the development, for example,
of cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) and economic impact assessments and
will also help achieve greater consistency and comparability between
different CBAs.

We are using whatever.   

In this, the `r ordinal(params$release_version)` edition:

* the title has been changed to “EUROCONTROL standard inputs for economic analyses”,
  a more accurate description of its use;
* the values have been regrouped by stakeholder and key topic of interest;
* all prices have been updated to 2019 euro values unless otherwise specified.
  The costs can be    easily adjusted using the table of indices contained in
  the section [Conversions, Inflation, Cost of Fuel, Exchange Rate](#conversions);
* some values have been reviewed and replaced, namely turn-around time,
  all causes of delay, and statistics;
* comparable historical data have been added;
* two new values have been introduced, namely drone fleet and U-space related
  investments;
* the value “cost of an ATFM slot swap” was removed because the UDPP concept
  has evolved and makes reference to “measures” (which involves multiple swaps).
  The value of a measure has a big range and is still being worked on;
* a link to the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Portal providing latest
  information was added when and where appropriate;
* whenever single values are contentious, a range of low, base and high values
  is given, allowing users of the data to conduct sensitivity analyses.


The standard inputs have been compiled from EUROCONTROL data and intelligence, from values provided by airspace users, ANSPs, airports, IATA, EASA and other organisations, and from other relevant documents which are publicly available.

They are average values and may not be appropriate in all circumstances. The document also gives details of the sources of information, and discusses the applicability and use of the values.

This document will remain a living document, and so comments and suggestions are very welcome. Readers are invited to send these to aviation.intelligence@eurocontrol.int.
