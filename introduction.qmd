# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This document provides a set of data commonly used in economic and financial analyses and appraisals, particulary in the field of ATM.

The aim of this document is to standardise the data used in the different ATM-related assessments, facilitate the data access for the different stakeholders involved and contribute to the comparaility of different analyses through relying on the same data.

In this edition ({{< var version >}}):

* A selection of values have been updated according to the latest data available and published on the web:
  + General parameters
  + Geographical areas
  + Air traffic statistics and forecasts
  + Number of IFR flights
  + Air traffic delay
  + Average number of passengers
  
* Three new values have been introduced:
  + Transit time
  + Shadow cost of carbon
  + Proportion of SAF

Please note that the standard inputs have been compiled from EUROCONTROL data and intelligence, from values provided by airspace users, ANSPs, airports, IATA, EASA and other organisations, and from other relevant documents which are publicly available.

They are average values and may not be appropriate in all circumstances. The document also gives details of the sources of information, and discusses the applicability and use of the values.

This document will remain a living document, and so comments and suggestions are very welcome. Readers are invited to send these to [economics.business-cases@eurocontrol.int](mailto:economics.business-cases@eurocontrol.int).
