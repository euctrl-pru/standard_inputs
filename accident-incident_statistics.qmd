# Accident/incident statistics {#sec-accident-incident-statistics}

## EUROCONTROL recommended sources

Hereafter are presented some sources that are recommended to be consulted to 
obtain latest statistics on accidents and incidents occurring in the aviation 
domain, as well as the related fatalities and injuries.

According to **ICAO Annex 13:**

An **accident** is an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft …,
in which (a) a person is fatally or seriously injured… or (b) the aircraft 
sustains damage or structural failure …or (c) the aircraft is missing or 
completely inaccessible . 

An **incident** is an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the
operation of an aircraft which affects or could affect the safety of operations.

The key sources are:

* **EASA Annual Safety Review** [@AnnualSafetyReview]
    provides both, a statistical summary of aviation safety in the EASA Member States 
    and identifies the most important safety challenges faced by European aviation today.
    The key statistics on accidents and serious incidents in the different aviation 
    domains can be found at the start of each chapter in the Annual Safety Review.

* **EUROCONTROL voluntary ATM incident reporting (EVAIR) safety bulletin** [@atmincidentreport]
    collects low-severity ATM incidents which involve pilots and controllers. The 
    established process and kinds of data provided by airlines and ANSP SMS allow 
    day to day analysis and, in this regard, identification of the causes of incidents.
    The data are collected from the entire ECAC region and from neighbouring airspace,
    such as the Eastern part of the ICAO EUR region, the Middle East, Africa, etc.


* **IATA Annual Safety Report** [@iata:safety:report]
    provides the industry with critical information derived from the analysis of 
    aviation accidents to enable to understand safety risks in the industry and to
    propose mitigation strategies.

## When to use the input?

This input is recommended to be used in the instances where the safety is an 
important factor, namely in terms of accident reduction.

    safety in general. It contains information about accidents and serious incidents
    by aircraft type and is also a portal which gives users access to the safety
    data made available on the websites of various aviation organisations 
    (regulators, service providers, industry)
