The first version of the Standard Inputs for EUROCONTROL Economic
Analyses series was launched in 2002 and has been kept alive for 20
years now, with the dedication of several colleagues, in particular
Paula and Desirée who put a lot of effort to this document. Today we
take a new step and are launching the latest edition on an online
platform to allow for timely and continuous updates of the values,
following the pace of change in the aviation world.

Our first launch includes a selection of six values, complemented with
some general information and the remaining inputs will be updated over
the coming months. You can access the previous edition for the values
that are not yet updated through a link in each of the value sections.

\markright{Acknowledgements}

We would like to show our gratitude to the many different colleagues
that have contributed to this endeavour by helping us develop the values
and get them online. Trying to name them would be impossible.

We have received valuable remarks and suggestions from all stakeholders
in the aviation value chain. In particular we have benefited from
stakeholders involved in the entire development life cycle, from ideas
to a working system. We strongly believe that this collaboration makes
the EUROCONTROL Standard Inputs for Economic Analyses a robust and
authoritative product.

Thank you all for making us learn every day!

This document provides a set of data commonly used in economic and
financial analyses and appraisals, particulary in the field of ATM.

The aim of this document is to standardise the data used in the
different ATM-related assessments, facilitate the data access for the
different stakeholders involved and contribute to the comparability of
different analyses through relying on the same data.

In this edition (10.0.2):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

Please note that the standard inputs have been compiled from EUROCONTROL
data and intelligence, from values provided by airspace users, ANSPs,
airports, IATA, EASA and other organisations, and from other relevant
documents which are publicly available.

They are average values and may not be appropriate in all circumstances.
The document also gives details of the sources of information, and
discusses the applicability and use of the values.

This document will remain a living document, and so comments and

The Statistics and Forecasts (STATFOR) service produces flights and
service units forecasts of future network traffic with a view to help
planners understand and manage risks, identify bottlenecks and
anticipate the needs of airspace users.

\hypertarget{medium-term-forecasts-7-year-timespan}{%
\subsection{Medium-term forecasts (7-year
timespan)}\label{medium-term-forecasts-7-year-timespan}}

The 7-year forecasts give a comprehensive picture of anticipated air
traffic development in Europe for the next seven years. They combine
flight statistics with economic growth and models of other industry
drivers, including costs, airport capacity, passenger numbers, load
factors and aircraft size. Using high and low growth scenarios, they
present a likely range for growth, to help planners manage risks. They
are published biannually, in spring and autumn, covering flights, en
route and terminal service units.

\end{figure}

The above graph shows the traffic forecast taking account of the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the base scenario, IFR flights are expected
to get back to 2019 levels by 2025.

Traffic statistics and forecasts can be obtained directly from the
STATFOR Interactive Dashboard
(SID)\protect\hyperlink{ref-ectrl:statfor:sid}{{[}5{]}}.

\hypertarget{long-term-forecasts-20-to-30-year-timespan}{%
\subsection{Long-term forecasts (20 to 30-year
timespan)}\label{long-term-forecasts-20-to-30-year-timespan}}

Twenty/thirty-year forecasts: These forecasts look at a range of
distinct possible scenarios for how the air traffic industry might look
in 20-30 years' time. This allows a range of \emph{what if?} questions
to be explored, for factors inside the industry (e.g.~the growth of
small business jets, or of point-to-point traffic) or outside the
industry (e.g.~the price of oil or environmental constraints).
Twenty/thirty-year forecasts are usually published every two to three
years. In April 2022, EUROCONTROL published its first EUROCONTROL
Aviation Outlook (EAO) looking out to 2050, much further than previous
forecasts. This forecast estimates a future number of flights and CO2
emissions per scenario, in line with aviation's objective of achieving
net-zero CO2 emissions by that date.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./figures/eao_2050_flights_base_scenario.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-Forecast-2050-plot}Flight forecast for Europe, with
total growth between 2019 and 2050}

\end{figure}

In the most-likely Base scenario, the forecast is for 16 million flights
in Europe in 2050, 44\% more than in 2019 -- average growth of 1.2\% per
year.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./figures/eao_2050_base_scenario.png}

\caption{\label{fig-co2-emissions-plot}Estimated CO2 emissions between
2005 and 2050 \protect\hyperlink{ref-aviation:outlook2022}{{[}6{]}}}

\end{figure}

The graph in Figure~\ref{fig-co2-emissions-plot} estimates that by 2050,
CO2 emissions, net of SAF, fleet and operational improvements, are
reduced by about 41\% compared to 2005 in the Base scenario.

\hypertarget{service-units-forecasts}{%
\subsection{Service units forecasts}\label{service-units-forecasts}}

Service Units are billed to airlines for the provision of air-traffic
services. They are of two types:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  En-route service units (TSU) that are taxed for the provision of
  en-route air traffic control and are a function of the weight and the
  distance flown within each state over which the concerned aircraft
  flies.

  Terminal Navigation Service Units (TNSU) are taxed for the provision
  of ground services to the airlines for each departure at a given
  airport. They are a function of the weight of the considered aircraft.
\end{itemize}

EUROCONTROL produces a 7-year forecast of Service Units that builds on
the 7-year IFR movements forecast, to which forecasts of the aircraft
weights and distances are added. This Service Units forecast is provided
as a service to states that are part of the Central Route Charges Office
(CRCO) to help them set-up their en-route units rates, if needed. The
Forecast of Service Units in general serves also as a benchmark for the
European Commission to assess the financial aspects of the performance
plans of the states that are bound by the performance and Charging
Scheme according to EU regulations (EU) N°390/201, N°391/2013.

In this document, capacity planning represents the systematic
determination of resource requirements for the projected output over a
specific period of time. It is a dynamic activity that relies on
constantly changing data on the ATM network use, capacity forecasts,
etc.

Given this, below are presented the sources that are recommended to
consult in order to obtain relevant up to date information on capacity
planning.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{\emph{EUROCONTROL European Network Operations Plan 2022-2026
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ectrl:nop:2022}{{[}7{]}}}}

  The European Network Operations Plan (NOP) provides a short- to
  medium-term outlook of the expected ATM network operations and
  performance at network and local level.

  It provides a detailed overview of capacity and flight efficiency
  enhancement measures planned at network level and by each Area Control
  Centre (ACC), a description of the airport performance assessment and
  improvement measures planned at airports generating a high level of
  delay, operational actions planned to be taken by the Network Manager
  and other stakeholders that would respond to the performance targets.
  Furthermore, it provides an assessment of the expected impact from
  these measures on the network.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{EUROCONTROL European Network Operations Plan (NOP) -
  Rolling Seasonal Plann
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ectrl:nop:rsp}{{[}8{]}}}}

  The European NOP Rolling Seasonal Plan is updated every Friday,
  focusing on the planning of the next six weeks and on the management
  of the execution and implementation of the 5-years NOP. Its aim is to
  facilitate ANSPs and airports planning to match traffic demand in a
  safe, efficient and coordinated manner by providing them with a
  consolidated European network view of the evolution of air traffic.

  More information about network performance (and access to dashboards
  and the archive) can be found at the
  \href{https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-performance}{Network
  Performance page}.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{European ATM Master Plan - implementation plan -- level
  3 \protect\hyperlink{ref-ectrl:mp:ip}{{[}9{]}} and European ATM Master
  Plan -- implementation report -- level 3
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ectrl:mp:ir}{{[}10{]}}}}

  The
  \href{https://www.eurocontrol.int/portal/european-atm-master-plan-portal}{\textbf{European
  ATM Master Plan}} is the main planning tool for setting ATM
  priorities, ensuring that the SESAR target concept becomes a reality.
  It is an evolving roadmap and the result of collaboration between all
  ATM stakeholders. The Master Plan provides a high-level view of what
  needs to be done in order to deliver a high-performing ATM system,
  while also explaining why and by when. It sets the framework for the
  development activities carried out by the SESAR Joint Undertaking
  (SJU) and deployed by stakeholders in partnership with the SESAR
  Deployment Manager (SDM).

  The \textbf{European ATM Master Plan - implementation plan -- level 3}
  is produced annually and provides the framework for the commonly
  agreed actions to be taken by ECAC stakeholders, in the context of the
  implementation of the SESAR Programme.

  These actions are consolidated in implementation objectives,
  addressing elements in SESAR which have reached the necessary
  operational and technical maturity and for which stakeholders have
  expressed an interest in their operational introduction. They provide
  all civil and military implementing parties (ANSPs, airport operators,
  airspace users and regulators) with a basis for short- to medium-term
  implementation planning.

  The \textbf{European ATM Master Plan - implementation report -- level
  3} maps the evolution of the Master Plan implementation on the four
  phases of the SESAR vision, as defined in the 2020 edition of the
  Executive view of the Master Plan, for the delivery of a Digital
  European Sky.

  The Implementation Objectives constitute the backbone of the Level 3
  and provide all civil and military implementing parties with a basis
  for short- to medium-term implementation planning. It also serves as a
  reference for States/National Supervisory Authorities (NSAs) to fulfil
  their roles regarding the supervision of safe and efficient provision
  of air navigation services as well as the timely implementation of
  SESAR.
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Local Single Sky ImPlementatiom (LSSIP) documents}}
  \protect\hyperlink{ref-ectrl:lssip}{{[}11{]}}

  The Local Single Sky ImPlementation (LSSIP) documents give a
  comprehensive overview of all ATM information for each of the ECAC
  Member States. They also show the ATM capacity forecasts and planning
  targets from NOP. The documents reflect progress made and detail the
  plans for each State for the next five to seven years.

  LSSIP documents, one for each State, are derived from the European
  Single Sky Implementation (ESSIP) (also known as Master Plan Level 3)
  objectives, and stakeholder lines of action cascade down into the
  States.

EUROCONTROL market segments were updated in 2022 and saw the
``Traditional Scheduled'' segment split into ``Mainline'' and
``Regional'' according to EUROCONTROL Market Segment Rules
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ectl:market:seg:2022}{{[}12{]}}.

In 2021 the total number of flights went up 25.1\% compared to 2020, but
was at 56.2\% of 2019 flight levels (pre-COVID-19). Compared with 2019,
only two segments increased in 2021 and they were All-Cargo (+13.9\%)
and Business Aviation (+3.8\%). The Mainline (-54.5\%), Low-Cost

perspectives:

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The view of airlines and passengers considering all causes of delay
\item
  A zoom-in to the view of the Network Manager focusing on Air Traffic
  Flow Management (ATFM) delays
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{all-causes-of-delay}{%
\subsection{All causes of delay}\label{all-causes-of-delay}}

Figure~\ref{fig-all-causes-delay} presents an \textbf{overview of all
causes of delay reported by the airlines} in 2020 and 2021. The figures
presented are estimated by the EUROCONTROL
\href{https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-performance}{Central Office of
Delay Analysis (CODA)}, and are calculated based on the comparison of
the scheduled and actual flight timings
\protect\hyperlink{ref-coda2021}{{[}14{]}}. They can be used in studies
that look into the different causes of flight delay experienced by
passengers and airlines.

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig-all-causes-delay}Breakdown of the network average
delay per flight on departure: 2021 vs 2020
\protect\hyperlink{ref-coda2021}{{[}14{]}}}

\end{figure}

The ATFM delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delay from all
causes, and around half of all delay is reactionary (i.e., delay caused
by late arrival of aircraft, crew, passengers or baggage from previous
journeys) rather than primary (i.e., delay other than reactionary).

\hypertarget{atfm-delay}{%
\subsection{ATFM delay}\label{atfm-delay}}

Looking specifically into \textbf{ATFM delay},
Figure~\ref{fig-atfm-delay} shows the daily traffic and traffic flow
delay per flight (en-route and at airport) for the period 2012-2021. The
figures presented are calculated by the Network Manager based on the
flight plans and include the planned ATFM delays due to the restrictions
that may be applied in the airspace
\protect\hyperlink{ref-nm2022}{{[}15{]}}.

\begin{figure}

}

\caption{\label{fig-atfm-delay}Average daily traffic and ATFM delay per

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{when-to-use-the-input-1}{%
\section{When to use the input?}\label{when-to-use-the-input-1}}

We recommend using all causes of delay provided by CODA when analysing
the impacts on airlines or on passengers/society (e.g., an airline
upgrading the avionics in their aircraft; airport expansion, etc.). On
the other hand, ATFM delay is recommended to be used when analysing
projects aiming at improving flow management.

Furthermore, since primary delay shows the delay that is due to direct
triggers, it is recommended to be used when analysing updates that would
impact the non-reactionary delays.

\hypertarget{comment}{%
\section{Comment}\label{comment}}

Looking at both figures above, it can be observed that the ATFM delay,
both at the airport and en-route, is higher when looking at the numbers
provided by the airlines rather than that observed by the Network
Manager. This occurs because the delay numbers provided by the Network
Manager account for the so-called planned delay due to restrictions in
the airspace, while the numbers provided by the airlines cover the total
delay they attribute to ATFM, whether they come from the restrictions or
any other planned ATFM delays

Another important point to take into consideration when analysing the
recommended values is the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Both, the
all-causes delay and the ATFM delay were impacted by the significant
reduction in air traffic in 2020 and 2021, resulting in a strong drop in
the total delay duration. Thus, when looking into these numbers it is
equally important to consider the situation prior to 2020. For the
All-causes delay this information can be found in the previous editions
of CODA Digest, available in EUROCONTROL library
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ectllibrary}{{[}16{]}}.

This metric is the ratio between the total flight hours controlled and
the IFR flights controlled, where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Total IFR flight-hours controlled is the sum of the flight-hours
  controlled over the year by the ANSP. For a given flight the
  flight-hours controlled are computed using information available in
  the Network Manager database as the difference between the exit time
  and the entry time in the controlled airspace
\item
  IFR movements controlled is the number of flights that have been
  controlled over the year by the ANSP
\end{itemize}

In \textbf{?@fig-transit-time}, the range of transit time values for the
vast majority of ANSPs in Europe can be observed (Note: the scope is
limited to the 38 ANSPs reporting to the
\href{https://ansperformance.eu/about/prc/}{Performance Review
Commission}). The European average in terms of flight time is 31 minutes
per ANSP. A difference of 49 minutes between the highest (DHMI Türkiye)
and the lowest (M-NAV North Macedonia) transit time can also be observed
-- this represents a ratio of almost 6 or a Standard Deviation of around
12.

This input is recommended for those projects where the flying time in a

example, it has previously been used for several CNS related studies, in
particular when studying the cost of communication services that depend

The data was recorded by the Network Manager (NM) for the 38 ANSPs that
were part of the ACE Report in 2019
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ace2019}{{[}17{]}}. For a few ANSPs, the data
reported show slight differences with the NM records, as ANSPs tend to
communicate their own traffic data. The differences are explained by the
different counting methodology in IFR airport movements for training
flights.

\section{Comments}\label{comments-1}}

The Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), a technical
committee of the ICAO Council, recommends the use a conversion factor of
\textbf{3.16 g of CO2 per gram of Jet A.} The 3.16 value can be found in
ICAO Doc 9889, 1st edition, 2011, and other documents.

However, in Europe, as early as 2009, Commission Decision 2009/339/EC
indicated an \textbf{emission factor of 3.15 for the mass conversion
from Jet A to CO\textsubscript{2}} for the period after January 2021.

In view of the above, emission factor 3.15 should continue to be used in
SESAR 2020, for the sake of internal consistency within the program,
unless the EU ETS decides to move to 3.16.

Factor 3.16 should be used when the evaluation concerns comparisons with
studies carried out within the ICAO framework or using the factor
recommended by ICAO, in order to ensure external consistency.

\section{Comments}\label{comments-2}}

In Economic Analyses the concept of `shadow cost' is often used when
working with an abstract commodity or intangible asset. Typically, two
elements are reflected in the `shadow cost':

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The cost of negative externalities such as pollution in this case
\item
  The shadow cost involves the consideration of future policies
\end{itemize}

Shadow costs are inexact by definition, as they are based on
assumptions, but their usefulness resides in that they help to
understand the full socio-economic merits of a project. Please note that
the shadow cost of carbon does not constitute in any way an optimal
value for any policy instrument.

Non-conventional fuels -- SAF are non-fossil derived -- can be used in
aviation if blended with conventional kerosene. Many experts agree that
this is the most promising option to reduce aviation emissions in the
short to medium term.

The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative -- put forward by the European
Commission in the Fit for 55 package -- imposes a mandate on fuel
suppliers to provide SAF in jet fuel available in EU airports. The
proposal defines a series of percentages of SAF blending that will have
to be met at specific years.

The Eurostat air transport domain contains national and international
intra- and extra-EU data. This provides air transport data for
passengers (in numbers of passengers) and for freight and mail (in
thousands of tonnes), as well as air traffic data for airports, airlines
and aircraft. Data are transmitted to Eurostat by the Member States of
the European Union as well as the candidate countries Iceland, Norway
and Switzerland. The air transport data have been calculated using data
collected at airports.

The average number of passengers per movement\footnote{A movement is
  either a take-off or a landing at an airport.} for a given year is
obtained by dividing the number of `departing passengers on board' by
the number of `departing flights for that year'.

The table below presents an overview of the average flight distance in
ECAC region, as well as the average flight time in the same region for
the period 2017-2021.

The data below was obtained by dividing the total distance actually
flown and the total yearly IFR flight hours respectively by the yearly
number of IFR flights in the ECAC airspace.

Please note that the numbers for 2020 and 2021 are considerably lower
due to the effect of pandemic.

\section{Description}\label{description-2}}

The Report on the Operation of the Route Charges System is published by
the CRCO on an annual basis and provides data on traffic volumes and ATM
costs for the States for which the CRCO collects en route and terminal
charges.

Table~\ref{tbl-distance-per-charging-zone} sets out the number of
millions of kilometers recorded in the airspace of the Contracting
States from 2014 to 2022 for the calculation of route charges (great
circle distance after deduction of 20 km for departing and arriving
flights) as well as the average annual variation observed during the
same period.

Information on the various different charges levied by the CRCO, in
particular the charge calculation methods, the basic billing documents,
the methods of payment and the submission of claims is described in
\href{https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/customer-guide-route-charges}{Customer

The source recommended to consult for the latest data on the cost of
aviation fuel is
\href{https://eurocontrol.sharepoint.com/sites/ECTL-Business_Cases/Shared\%20Documents/Standard_Inputs/1.\%20NEW_2022/Values/Cost\%20of\%20aviation\%20fuel/IATA\%20Jet\%20Fuel\%20Price\%20Monitor}{IATA
Jet Fuel Price Monitor}.

On its website, IATA provides jet fuel prices for the major regions of
the world, together with analysis and commentary. The values are based
on \href{http://www.platts.com/}{Platts Energy Market Data}.

When estimating the jet fuel price, consideration should be given to the
selection of the geographical area, and hence currency, as a change in
oil price can have a different effect on the jet fuel price owing to
currency fluctuations, e.g.~the downturn in the euro in 2015.

The `spread' between the aviation fuel price and the underlying oil
price covers the cost of refining, but it can vary significantly with
time depending on underlying demand (e.g.~from consumers needing a
similar fraction to aviation), and on supply problems (such as a
breakdown at a refinery or increasing local prices relative to oil).

\end{minipage}

\textbf{Consumer benefits} are the benefits for passengers, calculated
based on the difference between the consumer's willingness to pay (or
the gross consumer benefit) and the price paid.

\textbf{Producer benefits} are assessed from the investors' perspective,
relying on profitability measures such as return on invested capital
(ROIC). ROIC is calculated before payments of debt interest and shows
the earnings available to pay both debt and equity investors.
Furthermore, the calculation excludes fuel and labour related benefits.
The estimated profits of the fuel supply chain round € 11-35 billion per
year globally. The vast majority of these profits are allocated with the
crude oil suppliers.

\textbf{Wider economic benefits} represent those that go beyond the
direct impact on the users, such as any spillover effects from in
increased competition and more efficient movement of capital and labour.

One of the largest economic benefits of increased connectivity comes
from its impact on the long term productivity of the wider economy.
There are several approaches which may be used to quantify this benefit.
One conservative approach which has been developed, on the basis of the
statistical relationship between air connectivity and labour
productivity, yields an estimate that a \textbf{10\% rise in
connectivity, relative to a country's GDP, will boost labour
productivity levels by 0.07\%.}

\hypertarget{when-to-use-the-input-7}{%
\section{When to use the input?}\label{when-to-use-the-input-7}}

The use of these values depends on the scope and the viewpoint of the
analysis. For example, an assessment from the point of view of airlines
will focus on the benefits that an additional flight brings to airlines,
whereas an analysis from the perspective of a government or the European
Commission should also include an assessment of benefits for consumers
and the wider economy.

Note also that these values reflect the market conditions and the
passenger demand at the time of the study. For example, changes in
passengers' income, changes in their preferences for air transport or
changes in airlines' market structure can affect these values.

ANS en-route costs per Service Unit (TSU) in the above Value are
measured on the basis of the total actual and determined en-route ANS
costs (in real terms) divided by the number of en-route Service Units. A
Service Unit, used for the calculation of route charges, multiplies the
Aircraft Weight factor by the Distance factor.

The unit rate of charge is the charge in euros applied by a Charging
Zone to a flight operated by an aircraft of 50 metric tonnes (weight
factor of 1.00) and flying 100 kilometres (distance factor of 1.00) in
the charge area of that State.

The en-route ANS determined costs for a reference period of five years
are costs pre determined by the SES States as referred to in Article
15(2)(a) of
\href{http://eur\%20lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2004R0550:20091204:EN:PDF}{Regulation
(EC) No 550/2004}\\
for providing air navigation services. These include amounts for
interests on debt, return on equity, depreciation of assets, as well as
staff costs and non staff operating costs for maintenance, operations,
management and administration. These costs are determined on a national
level and comprise the costs of several entities (the National
Supervisory Authority, Air Navigation Service Provider(s), the MET
service provider and the State's contribution to EUROCONTROL budget).

\section{Description}\label{description-4}}

One full-time equivalent (FTE) is the equivalent of a single person
carrying out a particular job or activity working on a full-time basis
during a year. A part-time employee working half-time would be counted
as 0.5 FTEs. A full-time ATCO working two thirds of her time on duty in
ops and one third of her time on teaching at a training academy would be
counted as a 0.67 FTE ATCO in ops and a 0.33 FTE ATCO on other duties.

Employment costs comprise gross wages and salaries, payment for
overtime, employer contributions to social security schemes and taxes,
pension contributions and other benefits. For a study on employment
costs, the categories of staff working in an ANSP have been divided into
two:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{ATCOs in ops:} ATCOs participating in an activity which is
  either directly related to the control of traffic or where there is a
  necessary requirement for ATCOs to be able to control traffic
\item
  \textbf{Support staff or non-ATCO in ops:} this category includes all
  other staff. It includes ATCOs on other duties (participating in an
  activity outside ops, such as special projects, teaching at a training
  academy, providing instruction in a simulator, working in a full-time
  management position, etc.), trainees, ATC assistants, technical and
  operational support staff, administration staff, and others
\end{itemize}

The following table gives an overview of individual ANSPs and average
European system FTE costs for the two categories. The values were
calculated based on information extracted from EUROCONTROL ACE
Report\protect\hyperlink{ref-ace2020}{{[}28{]}}.

\section{Description}\label{description-5}}

The ACE benchmarking reports comprise data about and analysis of
cost-effectiveness and productivity for the ANSPs in EUROCONTROL's
Member States. The key performance drivers of cost-effectiveness are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Productivity
\item
  Employment costs
\item
  Support costs, comprising costs for non-ATCOs in OPS employment,
  non-staff operating costs, exceptional costs, depreciation and
  capital-related costs
\end{itemize}

The 2020 key performance drivers of financial cost-effectiveness for
each ANSP are summarised in Figure 0.4 of the source document
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ace2020}{{[}28{]}}. There is a wide variation in
each of the components:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ATCO productivity ranges from 0.08 to 1.29 (figure 2.8 of the source
  document)
\item
  Employment costs per ATCO-hour vary from a minimum of €16 to a maximum
  of €345 per ATCO-hour in purchasing power parity terms (figure 2.10 of
  the source document)
\item
  Support cost ratios as a component of gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness
  vary from 1.9 to 7.9 in 2020 (ratio G2G ANS staff/ATCOs in OPS in
  Annex 5; Table 0.5 of the source document

This input provides an estimation of the average value of passenger time
spent travelling, which might alternatively be spent on other activities
(e.g.~working or leisure). It is essentially the \textbf{opportunity
cost which corresponds to the monetary value associated with a passenger
during a journey.} It shows how much a passenger would be willing to pay
in order to save time during a journey (e.g.~by travelling on a quicker
service or using a faster transport mode), or how much `compensation'
they would accept, directly or indirectly, for lost time lost.

In Table~\ref{tbl-pas-value-of-time} is presented a collection of the
different values that can be used for this purpose. It is to be noted
that, in this section, the value of time is not cited as a function of
delay duration. This is an important consideration when using the value.
In this case, the longer the delay duration, the higher the value.

\section{When to use the input?}\label{when-to-use-the-input-8}}

This input is expected to become useful in any study that looks at the
opportunity cost of the use of air transport, delays, cancellations,
etc. It provides a perspective on the impact that a change in the air
transport can have on the passenger.

\hypertarget{comments-4}{%
\section{Comments}\label{comments-4}}

When looking into the values in the table, a few points regarding the
sources should be taken into consideration:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The source used for the UK values sets out a methodology for analysis
  which has been undertaken to estimate benefits from reduced delay time
  to airlines and passengers from changes in aviation capacity
  constraints in the UK for 11 airports.
\item
  The values for France rely on a working paper on recommended values
  for calculating the components of a socio-economic net present value,
  which include travel time. The assessment therefore covers social,
  environmental and economic effects.
\item
  Regarding the numbers for EU25, they remain a reference if a European
  value is sought. The objective of the study from which they were
  derived is to propose harmonised guidelines for project assessment for
  transnational projects in Europe. It provides monetary estimates for
  the values of time saved for employer's business and for passenger
  non-work trips (e.g.~commuting, shopping and leisure).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{other-values-to-consider}{%
\section{Other values to consider}\label{other-values-to-consider}}

Some additional values are available to EUROCONTROL, which, although not
constituting the perceived key inputs, may be useful for specific
purposes of the user of these inputs. These values are presented below.

\textbf{\emph{Value of time of a business aviation passenger}}

\textbf{€153 per hour.} This value was provided to EUROCONTROL by
airline members of the SESAR CBA team in 2012. This value is, therefore
adjusted form 2011 prices. Rationale: given that typical business jet
passengers are high level executives/CEOs, the passenger cost for lost
time adapted from Eurostat was estimated as being three times the value
of a regular flyer.

On this page is presented an overview of the \textbf{main statistics on
accidents and incidents occurring in the aviation domain}, as well as
the related fatalities and injuries. An overview of accidents related to
ATM/ANS is also provided. Each of the sections hereafter looks at a
different aviation segment within EASA Member States.

An \emph{accident} constitutes an occurrence associated with the
operation of an aircraft in which a person is fatally or seriously
injured and/or the aircraft sustains structural damage or is missing.

An \emph{incident} is an occurrence other than an accident, which
affects the safety of the aircraft.

The statistics presented hereafter are derived from EASA Annual Safety
Review, available on
\href{https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/general-publications?publication_type\%5b144\%5d=144\&page=1}{EASA
website}. Please refer to these documents for further details and
analysis on the data provided.

occurrences to which the ATM system may or may not have contributed but
may have played a role in preventing or mitigating similar occurrences
in the future.

The numbers presented hereafter consider occurrences that involve at

\section{EUROCONTROL recommended
values}\label{eurocontrol-recommended-values-17}}

Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) represents the monetary willingness to
pay for a lower risk of instantaneous premature death. It is often used
as a proxy to monetise the value of a fatality occurring form transport
accidents.

In Europe, based on a study published by the European Commission
\protect\hyperlink{ref-ecdgmove2019}{{[}21{]}} the \textbf{average
statistical value of life for EU27+UK is estimated at € 4.3 million.}
This value is adjusted to 2022 prices from 2016, based on inflation.

It is to note that the value of life differs based on the country,
circumstances, age, profession, education and a number of other
parameters. It also differs for different modes of transport. Thus,
different sources
{[}\protect\hyperlink{ref-easa2013}{{[}40{]}}{]}\protect\hyperlink{ref-ecdgregio2014}{{[}30{]}}\protect\hyperlink{ref-ecbr2021}{{[}41{]}}

specific circumstances.

The value of a statistical injury represents the \textbf{monetary value
of an improvement in safety to achieve a risk reduction which would
prevent one statistical injury.} It can be used as a proxy to monetise
the impact of an injury resulting from transport accidents.

Table~\ref{tbl-value-of-injury} shows the estimation of the value of an
injury as a fraction of the value of statistical life, following the
approach and numbers presented in the Handbook on the external costs of
transport . This approach assumes six levels of injury, where MAIS 1 and
MAIS 2 represent slight injury, MAIS 3 through MAIS 5 represent serious
injury and MAIS 6 represents fatality.

Thus, in the table are presented the levels of injury, the share that
the value of injury represents from the value of life and the calculated
cost of injury in euros, based on these percentages and the estimated
value of statistical life as presented in
Chapter~\ref{sec-value-of-a-statistical-life}.
