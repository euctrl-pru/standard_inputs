    "text": "Although we cannot foresee when, or even if, the world will return to what it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to publish this new edition of the standard inputs as a valuable source of inputs for economic and cost-benefit analyses in aviation. The recommended values are often based on 2019 statistics and data which do not yet take account of the impact of the pandemic.\nFor this edition, the focus is on environmental values, a new value for airports, turn-around time, and the introduction of two values related to drones. Drones represent a highly complex and fast-moving market, which makes forecasting more difficult than legacy aviation sectors. Suggestions for improvement and collaboration are welcome. Please send them to aviation.intelligence@eurocontrol.int.\nWe would like to make a special mention of the launch of the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Portal, which provides valuable and up-to-date information for economic analyses (https://ansperformance.eu/). The Portal will soon include the standard inputs (2021) and more information of use for cost-benefit analyses."

    "text": "1.3 Description\nThe objective of the Statistics and Forecast (STATFOR) service is to provide statistics and forecasts on air traffic in Europe and to monitor and analyse the evolution of the air transport Industry.\nIt produces the following:\n\nSeven-year forecasts The 7-year forecasts give a comprehensive picture of anticipated air traffic development in Europe for the next seven years. They combine flight statistics with economic growth and models of other industry drivers, including costs, airport capacity, passenger numbers, load factors and aircraft size. Using high- and low-growth scenarios, they present a likely range for growth, to help planners manage risks. We publish them biannually, in spring and autumn, covering flights, and en route and terminal service units every year.\nTwenty-year forecasts The 20-year forecasts look at a range of distinct possible scenarios for how the air traffic industry might look in 20 years’ time. This allows a range of ‘what if?’ questions to be explored, for factors inside the industry (e.g. the growth of small business jets, or of point-to-point traffic) or outside the industry (e.g. the price of oil or environmental constraints). Twenty-year forecasts are usually published every two to three years.\nAd-hoc publications, such as the Challenges to Growth reports, trends in air traffic studies and other analyses can be found in the EUROCONTROL library: https://www.eurocontrol.int/library\n\nTraffic statistics and forecasts can be obtained directly from the STATFOR Interactive Dashboard (SID): https://www.eurocontrol.int/dashboard/statfor-interactive-dashboard."

    "text": "2.3 Description\n\nSource 1\n\nThe Network Operations Plan (NOP) provides a short- to medium-term outlook of how the ATM network will operate. It gives details of capacity and flight efficiency enhancement measures planned at network level and by each area control centre (ACC), as well as a description of the airport performance assessment and improvement measures which are planned at those airports which generate a high level of delay.\n\nSource 2\n\nWith the turmoil related to the pandemic, the next edition of the NOP is temporally replaced by source 2, the NOP Rolling Seasonal Plan, a special version of the NOP which focuses on the planning of the next six weeks and in managing the execution and implementation of the 5-year NOP.  This Plan is currently playing a major role in helping European aviation to recover by providing aviation’s key actors with the global view they need in order to plan effectively. The NM is coordinating with all partners to ensure that capacity is available at ACCs, in the airspace they manage and on the ground at airports, in order to meet the expected traffic demand from the airlines on every day of the next six weeks. The plan is updated every Friday and reviewed every Monday by operational stakeholders in the Ad hoc Enlarged NDOP Recovery Cell, a body which brings Europe’s Network ANSPs, airports, airlines and military directors of operations together to enhance performance and tackle problems on a network basis, as inputs for the next edition.  Note that the normal NOP planning processes will be reinstated as from autumn 2021.  More information about network performance (and access to dashboards and the archive) can be found at https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-performance.\n\nSource 3\n\nThe European ATM Master Plan Level 3 (MPL3) Implementation Plan provides the framework for the commonly agreed actions to be taken by ECAC stakeholders, in the context of the implementation of the SESAR Programme.  These actions are consolidated in implementation objectives, addressing elements in SESAR which have reached the necessary operational and technical maturity and for which stakeholders have expressed an interest in their operational introduction. They provide all civil and military implementing parties (ANSPs, airport operators, airspace users and regulators) with a basis for short- to medium- term implementation planning.  The 2020 edition of the implementation plan focuses on the results of the SESAR 1 Programme. It highlights the contribution of each SESAR solution and implementation objective to capacity, operational efficiency, cost-efficiency, safety, the environment and security.  The plan integrates implementation objectives covering 20 SESAR solutions in order to ensure adequate coverage of the Pilot Common Project (PCP) requirements in relation to the SESAR Deployment Manager’s (SDM) deployment programme families.  It also fully addresses transition phase 1 of the Airspace Architecture Strategy up to 2025 through implementation objectives addressing 15 SESAR solutions.  The Master Level 3 Implementation Plan is produced annually.\n\nSource 4\n\nThe Local Single Sky Implementation (LSSIP) documents give a comprehensive overview of all ATM information for each State, hence they also show the ATM capacity forecasts and planning targets from the NOP. The documents reflect progress made and detail the plans for each ECAC State for the next five to seven years.  LSSIP documents, one for each State, are derived from the European Single Sky Implementation (ESSIP) (also known as Master Plan Level 3) objectives, and stakeholder lines of action cascade down into the States.  The information from the LSSIP documents is put together in the MPL3 Implementation Report to show progress at pan-European level. This report is also produced annually."

It has been prepared by the Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA), a EUROCONTROL service. It is based on delay data provided directly by airlines. This data on all causes of delay is derived by airlines, comparing actual timings with their published schedules.\nStatistics on all causes of delay can be obtained directly from the CODA Interactive Dashboard (CID) (a request for access is required). This dashboard aims to provide the user with an enhanced understanding of the causes of delay to flights, both that relating to air traffic flow management (ATFM) and non-ATFM-related delay. ATFM delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delays from all causes, and around half of all delay is reactionary rather than primary. Analyses within the dashboard are based on flight-by-flight data provided by airspace users as well as the Network Manager.\nMore information about CODA can be found at https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-performance (go to CID)."

    "text": "7.5 Comments\nThe Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), a technical committee of the ICAO Council, recommends the use a conversion factor of 3.16 g of \\(CO_2\\) per g of Jet A. The 3.16 value can be found in ICAO Doc 9889, 1st edition, 2011, and other documents.\nHowever, in Europe, as early as 2009, Commission Decision 2009/339/EC indicated an emission factor of 3.15 for the mass conversion from Jet A to CO2. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 of 19 December 2018 (on the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions), which integrates the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), applicable since 1 January 2019, for the period after January 2021, now recommends, for the time being, that factor 3.15 for Jet A fuel is still to be used in Europe for the ETS and also for CORSIA.\nIn view of the above, emission factor 3.15 should continue to be used in SESAR 2020, for the sake of internal consistency within the programme, and at least unless the EU ETS decides to move to 3.16. Nevertheless, factor 3.16 should be used when the evaluation concerns comparisons with studies carried out within the ICAO framework or using the factor recommended by ICAO, in order to ensure external consistency.

    "text": "8.3 Description\nThe CO2 price used to calculate the external costs of climate change in Value 1 is based on the cost avoidance approach. Extract from the “Handbook on the external costs of transport”: It determines external cost valuation factors (i.e. shadow prices) by determining the cost to achieve a particular policy target (e.g. EU CO2 reduction targets). This is done by estimating an avoidance cost function, which provides a proxy for the supply of environmental quality. It determines how much it would cost to supply an additional level of environmental quality (e.g. reduction of one additional tonne of CO2). Based on this cost curve, the minimal cost required to meet the policy target is estimated. The assumption is that this policy target reflects collective preferences with respect to the externality concerned and hence, that the minimum cost to reach this target is a good proxy of the (collective) willingness-to-pay (WTP) to avoid the damage caused by the externality.\nThe calculations for Value 2 and 3 have been made on the basis of the cost factor of €100 per tonne of \\(CO_2\\) equivalent, the central value for short- and medium-run estimates given in value 1. As was the case in the 2008 Handbook, it is further assumed that the aviation emissions relevant for air quality are restricted to the emissions in the landing and take-off (LTO) phases. The total emissions have been cross-checked with the total emission database from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme under the auspices of the European Environmental Agency (EMEP/EEA). The values are for passenger flights."

    "text": "9.3 Description\nThe table above was extracted from a study carried out by CE Delft (an independent research and consultancy organisation) on the external costs of different types of transport in Europe (tables 33 and 36). It gives an overview of the noise-related costs associated with people exposed to different noise level bands due to aviation. Two major aspects are considered in the study when assessing noise impact and cost:\n\nAnnoyance: This refers to the disturbance which individuals experience when they are exposed to noise (traffic noise in this case), e.g. discomfort, inconvenience.\nHealth impacts caused by long-term exposure to noise. The most common symptoms are stress- related health problems. Evidence has not been strong for all noise-related health impacts, and consequently in the European Handbook on External Costs of Transport, only the following health impacts are considered: hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and dementia. Insomnia is not included in order to avoid double-counting with the costs of annoyance.\n\nThe environmental price of noise reflects the welfare loss which occurs with one extra decibel (dB) of noise (CE Delft, 2018). The environmental price of noise needs to be determined implicitly, as there is no market for noise prevention. Previous editions of the European Handbook on External Costs of Transport have recommended using environmental prices based on HEATCO (2006), both for annoyance and health endpoints. HEATCO assumes a constant valuation per dB of noise for annoyance costs, which has recently been disputed. The new version of the Handbook therefore uses increasing prices per dB based on the most recent insights provided by Bristow et al. (2015) for annoyance costs. As for health costs, the prices according to Defra (2014) match the WHO’s recommendations in its latest systematic reviews, and are therefore used in the European Handbook on External Costs of Transport.\nComparable values for road and rail noise costs are also presented in the same study.\nHere is an example to show how the environmental price of noise should be applied in calculations: the annual cost for a person exposed to 57dB(A) of aviation noise would be equal to €439 (5dB x €41 + 3dB x €78)."

The main purpose of these guidelines is to provide recommendations for protecting human health from exposure to environmental noise originating from various sources, such as transportation (road traffic, railway and aircraft) noise, wind turbine noise and leisure noise.\nThe guidelines focus on the WHO European region and provide policy guidance to Member States which is compatible with the noise indicators used in the European Union’s Directive 2002/49/EC. For average noise exposure, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) strongly recommends reducing noise levels produced by aircraft below 45 dB Lden and for night noise exposure, below 40 dB Lnight. https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/383921/noise-guidelines-eng.pdf\n\n9.5.2 WHO (2009)\n“Night noise guidelines for Europe”,\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) set the European target limit for outdoor night noise levels at an annual average of 40 decibels (dB) in these guidelines.

It follows the guidelines of the ICAO Balanced Approach to Aircraft Noise Management and the rules defined to be applied to airports with more than 50 000 movements per year of civil aircraft. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0598\n\n9.5.7 European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions (2020)\n“Impact of aircraft noise pollution on residents of large cities”, ENVISA/ Study requested by the EU Parliament\nThis study, provided by the Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs at the request of the Committee on Petitions, aims to provide a clear and simple overview, for the non-expert reader, of the impact of aircraft noise pollution on residents of large cities, and to make recommendations addressed to the most relevant actors. https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/650787/IPOL_STU(2020)650787_EN.pdf\n\n9.5.8 ACI and CANSO (2015)\n“Managing the Impacts of Aviation Noise: A Guide for Airport Operators and Air Navigation Service Providers”\n“Managing the Impacts of Aviation Noise” examines the problem of aviation noise and describes methods which airport operators and ANSPs can use to manage and reduce its impact. It reviews four current approaches to managing noise, namely reducing noise at the source, land use planning, noise-reducing operational procedures, and operating restrictions. https://aci.aero/news/2015/09/23/aci-and-canso-launch-new-initiative-on-reducing-aviation-noise/"

    "text": "9.6 Example of estimating a noise reduction benefit\nThe “cost of noise” values can be used to calculate potential benefits in research project CBAs (cost- benefit analyses) in order to measure the monetary gain of a noise improvement. An example is the SESAR 2020 project Enhanced Arrival Procedures (EAPs). In this case, noise benefits were calculated as the reduction in the noise contour around the airport area when a different EAP concept was applied. The change in the noise contour area results were calculated per decibel band. This value was then multiplied by the number of people affected around the airport within a radius of 10 km, and the value of the cost of noise per person. The cost of noise (see table 1) is also calculated per decibel band. For noise contour results, scenarios were tested and compared using EUROCONTROL IMPACT tool[^ https://www.eurocontrol.int/platform/integrated-aircraft-noise-and-emissions-modelling-platform].\nAs mentioned in the further reading section, the EU in 2002 published Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise (the Environmental Noise Directive – END). The END, which is the main EU instrument to identify noise pollution levels, requires Member States to prepare and publish noise maps and noise management action plans every five years for major airports (more than 50 000 movements a year, including small aircraft and helicopters). https://ec.europa.eu/environment/noise/directive_en.htm\nThe NOISE Observation & Information Service for Europe of the EEA provides an interactive map displaying the exposure to NOISE levels from roads, railways, airports and industry. The map for airports illustrates the exposure to noise from airports in Europe during the average day and average night period. The example below is Brussels Airport. https://noise.eea.europa.eu/\n(ref:noise-at-bru) Exposure to noise from Brussels airport.\n\n\n\n\n(ref:noise-at-bru)"

    "text": "10.3 Description\nThe above values, provided by IATA, refer to the 2020 ACMG data collection (fiscal year 2019) and provide an overview of the operating costs for 10 types of aircraft (B737 NG, A320 family, B737 Classic, B777, A330, B757, B767, B787, EMB-190 and Dash 8).\nThe IATA Airline Cost Management Group (ACMG) collects operating costs classified into three categories, which are defined as follows:\n\n\nFlight operating expenses are direct operating expenses. They are directly related to the aircraft and the flight activities of an airline, such as flight crews, fuel, flight equipment and navigation. The biggest component of flight operating expenses is fuel and oil at 48%.\n\nGround operating expenses are also direct operating expenses. They are directly related to the ground activities of an airline, such as maintenance and overhaul, airport charges, station and ground. Maintenance and overhaul is the biggest cost component at 46%.\n\nSystem operating expenses are overheads and indirect operating expenses. They are not directly related to flight or ground operating expenses. They include costs for cabin attendants, passenger service, load insurance, reservations, ticketing, sales and promotion, IT and communications, and general and administrative costs, with the latter representing 34% of total system operating expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe airline cost structure for 2019:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values used for analysis are the result of aggregating the cost data provided by 51 airlines worldwide, covering over 35% of the industry in terms of revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs), with European airlines representing 16% of the share and 12% in terms of passengers carried.\nNote from IATA\nIn a number of jurisdictions, airport charges and taxes which are levied on a per-passenger basis are not accounted for in airline profit and loss accounts. As a result, the share of airport charges is likely to be significantly understated, as airports may levy more on a per-passenger or per-aircraft basis in some jurisdictions. To give an order of magnitude, in some regions the ACI (Airports Council International) estimates that over 50% of airport charges are collected on a per-passenger basis, reaching as much as 80% in some regions worldwide."

Cancelling a flight means that the airline forgoes a substantial operating profit. Also, in addition to the loss, costs are incurred for the care and compensation of passengers.\nCancellation costs vary as a function of the time of cancellation, as illustrated below.\nTimely cancellation will enable the airline to take the necessary measures to mitigate the cost impact, for example by rebooking passengers on another flight and allocating crew and aircraft to a different destination. The cancellation costs will thus be minimal and more in the region of the incurred opportunity cost and passenger value of time. If the cancellation is nearer the flight time, i.e. on the day of operation (D), the cost of cancellation increases, to cover expenses such as fuel, maintenance and crew and catering."
