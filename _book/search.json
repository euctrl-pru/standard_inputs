We would for sure forgot someone and this would be quite unfair.\nWe have received valuable remarks and suggestions from all stakeholders in the aviation value chain. In particular we have benefited from stakeholders involve in the entire development life cycle, from ideas to a working system. We strongly believe that this collaboration makes the Standard Inputs for EUROCONTROL Economic Analyses a robust and authoritative product.\nThank you all for making us learn every day!\nFinally, please allow us to make one only two exceptions.\n\nWe can only recognise the work of two colleagues in particular – Paula and Desirée – under who the initiative was born and developed for the past years.\nAnd our patient code teachers at PRU - Enrico and Oscar."

The recommended values are often based on 2019 statistics and data which do not yet take account of the impact of the pandemic.\nFor this edition, the focus is on environmental values, a new value for airports, turn-around time, and the introduction of two values related to drones. Drones represent a highly complex and fast-moving market, which makes forecasting more difficult than legacy aviation sectors. Suggestions for improvement and collaboration are welcome. Please send them to aviation.intelligence@eurocontrol.int.\nWe would like to make a special mention of the launch of the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Portal, which provides valuable and up-to-date information for economic analyses (https://ansperformance.eu/). The Portal will soon include the standard inputs (2021) and more information of use for cost-benefit analyses."

They combine flight statistics with economic growth and models of other industry drivers, including costs, airport capacity, passenger numbers, load factors and aircraft size. Using high- and low-growth scenarios, they present a likely range for growth, to help planners manage risks. We publish them biannually, in spring and autumn, covering flights, and en route and terminal service units every year.\nTwenty-year forecasts The 20-year forecasts look at a range of distinct possible scenarios for how the air traffic industry might look in 20 years’ time. This allows a range of ‘what if?’ questions to be explored, for factors inside the industry (e.g. the growth of small business jets, or of point-to-point traffic) or outside the industry (e.g. the price of oil or environmental constraints). Twenty-year forecasts are usually published every two to three years.\nAd-hoc publications, such as the Challenges to Growth reports, trends in air traffic studies and other analyses can be found in the EUROCONTROL library: https://www.eurocontrol.int/library\n\nTraffic statistics and forecasts can be obtained directly from the STATFOR Interactive Dashboard (SID): https://www.eurocontrol.int/dashboard/statfor-interactive-dashboard."

Traditional scheduled traffic increased by 1.4% and charter traffic by 2.7%, whilst business aviation decreased by 3% and cargo by 2.7%. Military traffic covering only those flights operating as general air traffic (GAT) and excluding operational air traffic (OAT) decreased by 4.7%.\nValue 3 Of those aircraft which flew IFR in 2019, four hundred and thirty-six (436) different civil aircraft types operated in Europe in 2019. Some 75% of the flights were carried out by the 20 aircraft types displayed."

These figures are estimated by EUROCONTROL Central Office of Delay Analysis (CODA), and they are calculated based on the comparison of the scheduled and actual flight timings and can be used in studies that look into the different causes of flight delay experienced by passengers and airlines.\n\nSource: EUROCONTROL CODA (2019) All-Causes Delay to Air Transport in Europe[1]\n\n\n4.2.2 ATFM delay\nLooking specifically into ATFM delay, the figure below shows the daily traffic and traffic flow delay per flight (en-route and at airport) for the period 2012-2021. These figures are calculated by the Network Manager based on the flight plans and include the planned ATFM delays due to the restrictions that may be applied in the airspace.\n\nSource: EUROCONTROL (2022) Network Operations Report 2021[2]\nThe flow management delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delay from all causes, and around half of all delay is reactionary (i.e., delay caused by late arrival of aircraft, crew, passengers or baggage from previous journeys) rather than primary (i.e., delay other than reactionary)."

    "text": "4.4 Comment\nLooking at both figures above, it can be observed that the ATFM delay, both at the airport and en-route, is higher when looking at the numbers provided by the airlines rather than that observed by the Network Manager. This occurs because the delay numbers provided by the Network Manager account for the so-called planned delay due to restrictions in the airspace, while the numbers provided by the airlines cover the total delay they attribute to ATFM, irrespective from the restrictions or any planned ATFM delays.\nAnother important point to take into consideration when analysing the recommended values is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both, the all-causes delay and the ATFM delay were impacted by the significant reduction in air traffic in 2020 and 2021, resulting into a strong drop in the total delay duration. Thus, when looking into these numbers it is equally important to consider the situation prior to 2020. For the All-causes delay this information can be found in the previous editions of CODA Digest, available in EUROCONTROL library."
