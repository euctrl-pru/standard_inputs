    "text": "Although we cannot foresee when, or even if, the world will return to what it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to publish this new edition of the standard inputs as a valuable source of inputs for economic and cost-benefit analyses in aviation. The recommended values are often based on 2019 statistics and data which do not yet take account of the impact of the pandemic.\nFor this edition, the focus is on environmental values, a new value for airports, turn-around time, and the introduction of two values related to drones. Drones represent a highly complex and fast-moving market, which makes forecasting more difficult than legacy aviation sectors. Suggestions for improvement and collaboration are welcome. Please send them to aviation.intelligence@eurocontrol.int.\nWe would like to make a special mention of the launch of the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Portal, which provides valuable and up-to-date information for economic analyses (https://ansperformance.eu/). The Portal will soon include the standard inputs (2021) and more information of use for cost-benefit analyses."

    "text": "1.3 Description\nThe objective of the Statistics and Forecast (STATFOR) service is to provide statistics and forecasts on air traffic in Europe and to monitor and analyse the evolution of the air transport Industry.\nIt produces the following:\n\nSeven-year forecasts The 7-year forecasts give a comprehensive picture of anticipated air traffic development in Europe for the next seven years. They combine flight statistics with economic growth and models of other industry drivers, including costs, airport capacity, passenger numbers, load factors and aircraft size. Using high- and low-growth scenarios, they present a likely range for growth, to help planners manage risks. We publish them biannually, in spring and autumn, covering flights, and en route and terminal service units every year.\nTwenty-year forecasts The 20-year forecasts look at a range of distinct possible scenarios for how the air traffic industry might look in 20 years’ time. This allows a range of ‘what if?’ questions to be explored, for factors inside the industry (e.g. the growth of small business jets, or of point-to-point traffic) or outside the industry (e.g. the price of oil or environmental constraints). Twenty-year forecasts are usually published every two to three years.\nAd-hoc publications, such as the Challenges to Growth reports, trends in air traffic studies and other analyses can be found in the EUROCONTROL library: https://www.eurocontrol.int/library\n\nTraffic statistics and forecasts can be obtained directly from the STATFOR Interactive Dashboard (SID): https://www.eurocontrol.int/dashboard/statfor-interactive-dashboard."

It has been prepared by the Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA), a EUROCONTROL service. It is based on delay data provided directly by airlines. This data on all causes of delay is derived by airlines, comparing actual timings with their published schedules.\nStatistics on all causes of delay can be obtained directly from the CODA Interactive Dashboard (CID) (a request for access is required). This dashboard aims to provide the user with an enhanced understanding of the causes of delay to flights, both that relating to air traffic flow management (ATFM) and non-ATFM-related delay. ATFM delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delays from all causes, and around half of all delay is reactionary rather than primary. Analyses within the dashboard are based on flight-by-flight data provided by airspace users as well as the Network Manager.\nMore information about CODA can be found at https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-performance (go to CID)."

    "text": "4.3 Description\nThe CO2 price used to calculate the external costs of climate change in Value 1 is based on the cost avoidance approach. Extract from the “Handbook on the external costs of transport”: It determines external cost valuation factors (i.e. shadow prices) by determining the cost to achieve a particular policy target (e.g. EU CO2 reduction targets). This is done by estimating an avoidance cost function, which provides a proxy for the supply of environmental quality. It determines how much it would cost to supply an additional level of environmental quality (e.g. reduction of one additional tonne of CO2). Based on this cost curve, the minimal cost required to meet the policy target is estimated. The assumption is that this policy target reflects collective preferences with respect to the externality concerned and hence, that the minimum cost to reach this target is a good proxy of the (collective) willingness-to-pay (WTP) to avoid the damage caused by the externality.\nThe calculations for Value 2 and 3 have been made on the basis of the cost factor of €100 per tonne of \\(CO_2\\) equivalent, the central value for short- and medium-run estimates given in value 1. As was the case in the 2008 Handbook, it is further assumed that the aviation emissions relevant for air quality are restricted to the emissions in the landing and take-off (LTO) phases. The total emissions have been cross-checked with the total emission database from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme under the auspices of the European Environmental Agency (EMEP/EEA). The values are for passenger flights."

The continued growth of the sector has produced economic benefits and connectivity within Europe and is stimulating investment in novel technology. This draws on a wider pool of expertise and innovative approaches from other sectors, thereby creating potential new opportunities to address the environmental impacts of aviation. However, it is recognised that the contribution of aviation activities to climate change, noise and air quality impacts is increasing, thereby affecting the health and quality of life of European citizens.\nPara. 5.3 touches on environmental charges levied by some airports.\n\n\nEuropean Commission  https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/auctioning_en  https://www.eex.com/en/\nExtracted from the EC website: “Twenty-eight countries (25 EU Member States and 3 EEA/EFTA countries) auction their allowances on the common auction platform. The common auction platform is nominated for up to five years by a joint procurement between the Commission and the participating countries, in accordance to the rules laid down by the joint procurement agreement. Currently, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Leipzig is the common auction platform. Some countries participating in the EU ETS have opted out of the common auctioning platform: Germany has nominated EEX as its opt-out platform. Poland is making use of the common auction platform to auction its share of allowances until the appointment of its opt-out platform.

    "text": "4.6 Comments\nWith regard to NOx charges, a LTO NOx charge is currently applied at several European airports. The level of the charge per kg of NOx is set according to the cost of damage caused by NOx to local air quality (LAQ), at or near airports. The charge is levied in several countries, namely Sweden, the UK, Germany, Demark and Switzerland. Two examples are provided below.\n\n4.6.1 London Heathrow\nAt London Heathrow, a NOx emission charge is payable on each movement (per LTO cycle) by a fixed-wing aircraft over 8 618 kg. The charge per kg of NOx is calculated on the aircraft’s ascertained NOx emission[^An aircraft’s ascertained NOx emission means the product of the engine NOx emission as set out in the ICAO Emission Database and based on the number of engines on the aircraft.]. https://www.heathrow.com/content/dam/heathrow/web/common/documents/company/doing- business-with-heathrow/flights-condition-of-use/structure-of-charges- decision/Airport_Charges_Decision-5-August-2015.pdf\nThe Emissions Airport Charges for 2020 per kg of NOx is £16.84 (€20.5 at the 2019 exchange rate) “Decision – 2020 Airport Charges” https://www.heathrow.com/content/dam/heathrow/web/common/documents/company/doing-business-with-heathrow/flights-condition-of-use/conditions-of-use-documents/Heathrow_Airport_Charges_and_Conditions_of_Use_2020.pdf\n\n4.6.2 Copenhagen Airports\nCopenhagen Airports support, through financial incentives, the use of engine types which emit the lowest emissions. The model used for calculating emissions and charges is based on the models currently found in Sweden and Switzerland. The model works with absolute NOx emissions of a specific aircraft engine during a standardised landing and take-off cycle (LTO). NOx emissions per aircraft engine are based on the ICAO specifications and guidelines. The published emissions charge (November 2020) is kr.16.50 per kg NOx (€2.2 at the 2019 exchange rate). https://www.cph.dk/en/cph-business/aviation/charges-and-slot/calculation-of-emission-charges"
