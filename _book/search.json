These figures are estimated by EUROCONTROL Central Office of Delay Analysis (CODA), and they are calculated based on the comparison of the scheduled and actual flight timings and can be used in studies that look into the different causes of flight delay experienced by passengers and airlines.\n\nSource: EUROCONTROL CODA (2019) All-Causes Delay to Air Transport in Europe[1]\n\n\n4.2.2 ATFM delay\nLooking specifically into ATFM delay, the figure below shows the daily traffic and traffic flow delay per flight (en-route and at airport) for the period 2012-2021. These figures are calculated by the Network Manager based on the flight plans and include the planned ATFM delays due to the restrictions that may be applied in the airspace.\n\nSource: EUROCONTROL (2022) Network Operations Report 2021[2]\nThe flow management delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delay from all causes, and around half of all delay is reactionary (i.e., delay caused by late arrival of aircraft, crew, passengers or baggage from previous journeys) rather than primary (i.e., delay other than reactionary)."

    "section": "4.4 Comment",
    "text": "4.4 Comment\nLooking at both figures above, it can be observed that the ATFM delay, both at the airport and en-route, is higher when looking at the numbers provided by the airlines rather than that observed by the Network Manager. This occurs because the delay numbers provided by the Network Manager account for the so-called planned delay due to restrictions in the airspace, while the numbers provided by the airlines cover the total delay they attribute to ATFM, irrespective from the restrictions or any planned ATFM delays.\nAnother important point to take into consideration when analysing the recommended values is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both, the all-causes delay and the ATFM delay were impacted by the significant reduction in air traffic in 2020 and 2021, resulting into a strong drop in the total delay duration. Thus, when looking into these numbers it is equally important to consider the situation prior to 2020. For the All-causes delay this information can be found in the previous editions of CODA Digest, available in EUROCONTROL library."

Typically, two elements are reflected in the ‘shadow cost’: - Firstly, the cost of negative externalities such as pollution in this case. - Secondly, the ‘shadow’ prices involves the consideration future policies.\nShadow prices are inexact by definition – they are based on assumptions – but their usefulness resides in that they help to understand the full socio-economic merits of a project. Please note the SPC does not constitute in any way an optimal value for any policy instrument.\nThe concept is clearly explained with the graph below produced by the EIB (page 116)."

Data are transmitted to Eurostat by the Member States of the European Union as well as the candidate countries Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.
