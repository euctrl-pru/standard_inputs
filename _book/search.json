    "text": "Although we cannot foresee when, or even if, the world will return to what it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to publish this new edition of the standard inputs as a valuable source of inputs for economic and cost-benefit analyses in aviation. The recommended values are often based on 2019 statistics and data which do not yet take account of the impact of the pandemic.\nFor this edition, the focus is on environmental values, a new value for airports, turn-around time, and the introduction of two values related to drones. Drones represent a highly complex and fast-moving market, which makes forecasting more difficult than legacy aviation sectors. Suggestions for improvement and collaboration are welcome. Please send them to aviation.intelligence@eurocontrol.int.\nWe would like to make a special mention of the launch of the EUROCONTROL Aviation Intelligence Portal, which provides valuable and up-to-date information for economic analyses (https://ansperformance.eu/). The Portal will soon include the standard inputs (2021) and more information of use for cost-benefit analyses."

    "text": "1.3 Description\nThe objective of the Statistics and Forecast (STATFOR) service is to provide statistics and forecasts on air traffic in Europe and to monitor and analyse the evolution of the air transport Industry.\nIt produces the following:\n\nSeven-year forecasts The 7-year forecasts give a comprehensive picture of anticipated air traffic development in Europe for the next seven years. They combine flight statistics with economic growth and models of other industry drivers, including costs, airport capacity, passenger numbers, load factors and aircraft size. Using high- and low-growth scenarios, they present a likely range for growth, to help planners manage risks. We publish them biannually, in spring and autumn, covering flights, and en route and terminal service units every year.\nTwenty-year forecasts The 20-year forecasts look at a range of distinct possible scenarios for how the air traffic industry might look in 20 years’ time. This allows a range of ‘what if?’ questions to be explored, for factors inside the industry (e.g. the growth of small business jets, or of point-to-point traffic) or outside the industry (e.g. the price of oil or environmental constraints). Twenty-year forecasts are usually published every two to three years.\nAd-hoc publications, such as the Challenges to Growth reports, trends in air traffic studies and other analyses can be found in the EUROCONTROL library: https://www.eurocontrol.int/library\n\nTraffic statistics and forecasts can be obtained directly from the STATFOR Interactive Dashboard (SID): https://www.eurocontrol.int/dashboard/statfor-interactive-dashboard."

    "text": "3.3 Description\nThe report identified in the source value gives an overview of the delay situation in the European Civil Aviation Conference area. It has been prepared by the Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA), a EUROCONTROL service. It is based on delay data provided directly by airlines. This data on all causes of delay is derived by airlines, comparing actual timings with their published schedules.\nStatistics on all causes of delay can be obtained directly from the CODA Interactive Dashboard (CID) (a request for access is required). This dashboard aims to provide the user with an enhanced understanding of the causes of delay to flights, both that relating to air traffic flow management (ATFM) and non-ATFM-related delay. ATFM delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delays from all causes, and around half of all delay is reactionary rather than primary. Analyses within the dashboard are based on flight-by-flight data provided by airspace users as well as the Network Manager.\nMore information about CODA can be found at https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-performance (go to CID)."
