# Asset life {#sec-asset-life}

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

The table below presents the accounting period, in years, for a given asset used
to derive the amortisation of investment expenditure.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(gt)

#| label: tbl-asset-life
#| tbl-cap: Estimated asset life

read_xlsx("data/asset_life.xlsx") %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  cols_label(
    asset = "Asset type",
    min = "Expected life (years)",
    max = "Maximum expected life"
  ) %>% 
  cols_align(
    align = "center",
    columns = min:max
  ) %>% 
  cols_merge_range(min, max, sep = "--", autohide = TRUE) %>% 
  tab_source_note(
    source = md("*Source: EUROCONTROL (2011), Principles for Establishing the Cost-Base for Route Charges and the Calculation of the Unit Rates*")
  )
```

Asset life as used in cost-benefit analyses reflects the expected operating life 
of the specific equipment concerned, which is also the basis for calculating 
depreciation costs which are taken into account to determine route charges.

The above data provide indicative parameters for classes of equipment for 
economic analyses. The actual percentages to be applied in calculating the 
depreciation of fixed assets must be determined in accordance with the expected
operating life and the pertinent [International Financial Reporting Standards](https://www.ifrs.org/) 
issued by the [International Accounting Standards Board](https://www.ifrs.org/groups/international-accounting-standards-board/).
