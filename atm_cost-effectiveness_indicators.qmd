## EUROCONTROL recommended values

This section considers some key performance indicators of cost-effectiveness and
productivity for the Air Navigation Services Providers (ANSPs) in the EUROCONTROL Area.

The table below shows the trends in European system averages since 2015.

The pandemic reduced drastically the flight-hours in 2020, hence the change in the trend.

## Description

The ACE benchmarking reports comprise data about and analysis of cost-effectiveness 
and productivity for the ANSPs in EUROCONTROL’s Member States. The key performance
drivers of cost-effectiveness are:

* Productivity

* Employment costs

* Support costs, comprising costs for non-ATCOs in OPS employment, non-staff 
operating costs, exceptional costs, depreciation and capital-related costs

The 2020 key performance drivers of financial cost-effectiveness for each ANSP 
are summarised in Figure 0.4 of the source document [@ace2020]. There is a wide variation
in each of the components:

* ATCO productivity ranges from 0.08 to 1.29 (figure 2.8 of the source document)

* Employment costs per ATCO-hour vary from a minimum of €43 to a maximum of €298 
per ATCO-hour in purchasing power parity terms (Figure 2.11 of the source) 

* Support staff ratios   as a component driver of gate-to-gate cost-effectiveness
vary from 1.9 to 7.9 in 2020 (ratio columns “Total staff”G2G ANS staff/”ATCOs 
in OPS” in Annex 5; Table 0.5   of the source)

The employment costs above refer to gate-to-gate cost, i.e. en route and terminal
costs, and are expressed in nominal prices.
