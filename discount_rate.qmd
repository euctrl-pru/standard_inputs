# Discount rate {#sec-discount-rate}

## EUROCONTROL recommended value

Discount rate is the annual rate used to discount a stream of cashflows in order to calculate their Net Present Value (NPV).

The **discount rate recommended to be used for the EU is 4%.**^[[European Commission (2014), Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 480/2014, Article 19 (Discounting of Cash Flow)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.138.01.0005.01.ENG )]

## Description

A nominal discount rate has three components:

* a basic, risk-free, time value of money (TVM) – traditionally of the order of 2.5%

* compensation for the erosion of the principal by inflation

* a premium for risk

The inflation element should only be included if the cash flows are expressed in 
'money of the day' and should be excluded if the cash flows are expressed at
constant price levels. The recommended value is inflation-free and only takes 
into account TVM and the risk premium.

The assessment of the risk premium depends on the judgment of the investor and 
can only be analysed over a portfolio of investments. In the case of investment
in an air traffic management system, the risk being evaluated is the risk that 
the system will operate successfully and generate the benefits expected. It is 
not related to the commercial viability of aircraft operators using the system.

The value is used as an indicative benchmark in (EUROCONTROL) business cases for
ATM investments and is applied to costs incurred and benefits achieved by air 
navigation service providers, aircraft operators and any other parties involved.

Values differing from the 4% benchmark can, however, be justified on the grounds
of local and individual conditions which affect the requisite risk premium.

## Other recommended values

Another way to calculate the discount rate is by using the Weighted Cost of Capital (WACC)
metric. According to Implementing Regulation 2019/317 art. 22 (4),[@ir2019317] WACC is defined as
the average of the return on equity and the interest rate on debt, weighted by 
the capital structure. According to the same source, the WACC relevant for the 
assessment of performance plans is the cost of capital pre-tax rate.

In their Study on cost of capital, methodology review and update report, [@prb2021]  the
Performance Review Body (PRB) of the Single European Sky performed an assessment 
of the cost of capital for the ANSPs of the Single European Sky Member States.

The methodological approach taken by PRB calculates efficient costs of capital 
and combines them with a check on the maximum exposure due to the traffic-risk 
sharing mechanism.^[Please refer to the source document for further details]  The cost of capital is assessed according to four options^[See table 2 of the source document]  
that are summarised as follows:

* **Option 1** should be used when the WACC of an ANSP is based on an actual capital structure that is not aligned to the optimal capital structure

* **Option 2** should be used if it is lower than Option 1 for an ANSP that is subject 
to a government-specified equity return

* **Option 3** should be used if it is lower than Option 1 for an ANSP that has access
to loan finance on favourable terms but is not subject to a government-specified
equity return 

* **Option 4** is an additional sense check of the cost of capital (the WACC times
the asset base) and the maximum risk exposure of the ANSP (4.4% of revenues)

Option 1 is used as a reference here because it constitutes the baseline value 
in the study, while the remaining three options are subject to specific 
circumstances described above.

As a result of this assessment, the **average estimated pre-tax WACC in 2022 for all Member States’ ANSPs for option 1 amounts 4.6%.**

According to PRB, Options 2-4 of the methodological framework may result in lower
numbers than Option 1 if the ANSP is subject to a lower government-specified
return on equity (Option 2), if the ANSP obtains loan finance on more favourable
terms (Option 3), or if the WACC implied by the maximum exposure of the ANSP is 
lower (Option 4).

## Comments

Different approaches to determining discount rates can be used (social rate of time preference, marginal social opportunity cost of capital, weighted average cost of capital, shadow price of capital). A description of these approaches goes beyond the limits of this document.

The choice of an appropriate social discount rate for the cost-benefit analysis of public projects has long been a contentious issue and subject to intense debate by economists.

Since the choice of discount rate is a matter of judgment, it is recommended that in project appraisals the sensitivity analysis should include a consideration of the effect of differing discount rates. Note that the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate which will give an NPV of zero and thus gives the effective overall return on an investment over the period under consideration.
