# IFR flight information per market segment {#sec-ifr-flight-information-per-market-segment}

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

@tbl-ifr-info shows the mean distance, fuel consumption and flight duration of 
an IFR flight, per market segment,^[Rules for the EUROCONTROL classification of low-cost, all-cargo and business aviation types of flights:   https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/market-segment-rules] in ECAC region.
These values refer to year 2019.

## Description

The calculations were made on the basis of:

* 2019 full year total distance and ECAC distance flown, extracted from data collected by the Network Manager, not including overflights

* the EUROCONTROL Small Emitters Tool (SET) approved by the European Commission by Commission Regulation (EU) No 606/2010

* use of the latest version of the BADA  tabulated model 4 and AEM (Advanced Emission Model)

* fuel burn figures, not taking into account the reduction in the aircraft's weight in fuel during the flight
