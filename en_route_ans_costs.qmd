# En-route ANS costs {#sec-en-route-ans-costs}

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

This input represents the costs of Air Navigation Services (ANS) in en-route 
airspace that is under the control of States/ANSPs.

[@tbl-ans-costs] shows the **real en-route ANS cost per TSU for EUROCONTROL area.** 
The monetary values are presented in 2020 prices.

## Description

ANS en-route costs per Service Unit (TSU) in the above Value are measured on the
basis of the total actual and determined en-route ANS costs (in real terms) 
divided by the number of en-route Service Units. A Service Unit, used for the 
calculation of route charges, multiplies the Aircraft Weight factor by the 
Distance factor.

:::{.callout-note}
Please note the difference between [Total Service Units (TSU)](https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/su/) and [Terminal Service Units (TNSU)](https://ansperformance.eu/acronym/tnsu/).
:::

:::{.callout-note}
The Unit Rate of Charge is the charge in euro applied by a Charging Zone to a 
flight operated by an aircraft of 50 metric tonnes (weight factor of 1.00) and 
flying 100 kilometres (distance factor of 1.00) in the charge area of that State.  

Further information on calculating unit rates can be found on [customer guide to charges website](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/customer-guide-route-charges)
:::

The en-route ANS determined costs for a reference period of five years are costs 
pre determined by the SES States as referred to in Article 15(2)(a) of [Regulation
(EC) No 550/2004](http://eur lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2004R0550:20091204:EN:PDF)  
for providing air navigation services. These include amounts 
for interests on debt, return on equity, depreciation of assets, as well as staff 
costs and non staff operating costs for maintenance, operations, management and
administration. These costs are determined on a national level and comprise the 
costs of several entities (the National Supervisory Authority, Air Navigation 
Service Provider(s), the MET service provider and the State’s contribution to EUROCONTROL budget).

## Other sources

Other source could be the EUROCONTROL Central Route Charges Office. At the time
of writing this update of the EUROCONTROL Standard Inputs for Economic Analyses,
the most recent published version is the [2021 Report on the Operation of the
Route Charges System](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/report-operation-route-charges-system-2021).
Please, check regularly the [CRCO full list of reports on the operation of the route charges system](https://www.eurocontrol.int/library/search?f%5B0%5D=activity%3A768&f%5B1%5D=topic%3A1159&f%5B2%5D=activity%3A768&f%5B3%5D=topic%3A1159) 
for the latest information.

The CRCO calculates route charges using flight messages sent by the Contracting 
States’ Route Charges Offices (CRCOs) and additional flight information made 
available via the EUROCONTROL Network Management Directorate (NMD). The CRCO bills 
aircraft operators on a monthly basis, collects charges and disburses the amounts
collected to the States every week. 

## Comment

Terminal ANS costs and ANSP gate to gate economic performance are described 
separately in chapter 6 of the EUROCONTROL Performance Review Report [@ectrlprr2022].
