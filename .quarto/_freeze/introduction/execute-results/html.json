The document also gives details of the sources of information, and discusses the applicability and use of the values.\n\nThis document will remain a living document, and so comments and suggestions are very welcome. Readers are invited to send these to aviation.intelligence@eurocontrol.int.\n\n\n## Details per data item {.unlisted .unnumbered}\n\nFor each standard input, the following information is provided, where relevant.\n\n|      Section     |  Description |\n|:-----------------|:-------------|\n| Definition       | A statement which describes the concept. |\n| EUROCONTROL recommended value or source | One or a set of recommended values or sources put forward by EUROCONTROL for the specific indicator. |\n| Source and date | The source documents and their publication dates. |\n| Description     | Any relevant information or details regarding the standard input. Information can be found here on how the value is computed, the specific use of the indicator, etc. Information regarding the limitations on using the values may also be included. |\n| Other possible values | Other values found in different sources, which are included for the purpose of information or discussion. |\n| Related standard inputs | A link to other related standard inputs included in the document in order to increase its consistency. |\n| Further reading | References to other interesting sources. |\n| Comments | Any questions or further comments regarding the source or derivation of the value, for example the degree of confidence in the values and sources cited. |\n\n",
