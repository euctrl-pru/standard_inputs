Trying to name them would be\nmission impossible. We would for sure forgot someone and this would be\nquite unfair.\n\nWe have received valuable remarks and suggestions from all stakeholders\nin the aviation value chain. In particular we have benefited from\nstakeholders involve in the entire development life cycle, from ideas to\na working system. We strongly believe that this collaboration makes the\nStandard Inputs for EUROCONTROL Economic Analyses a robust and\nauthoritative product.\n\nThank you all for making us learn every day!\n\nFinally, please allow us to make one only two exceptions.\n\n-   We can only recognise the work of two colleagues in particular --\n    Paula and Desir√©e -- under who the initiative was born and developed\n    for the past years.\n\n-   And our patient *code teachers* at PRU - Enrico and Oscar.\n\n## About us\n\nWe are the ECTTL Business Case team.\n\nExplain further.\n\n## History\n\nIt looks long time ago that we launched the Standard Inputs for\nEUROCONTROL Economic Analyses series. Our first edition dates back into\nXXXX. The document was born as the Business Cases Team own internal need\nto have a common reference of economic inputs to use in our multiple ATM\neconomic analyses.\n\n## This year\n\nFor this special edition we will be using an incremental approach. We\nare publishing inputs at the time we finished them.\n\n## New\n\nFurther focus on work from other EU Aviation public bodies. Notably EC,\nSJU, SDM and EIB. Digitalisation. We will be using the advantages of\ndigitalisation. Will be a live document with more frequent updates. You\nwill be able to download most of the data we propose for your own\npurposes.\n\n## Coming soon\n\nWe are working to integrate the newcomers, RPAs. Specific focus on\nenvironmental considerations. Comparison with other equivalent\ninitiatives, notably FAA and CAA Australia. Inclusion or Rotorcraft. A\nfleet projection.\n\nWe are happy to receive any comment or suggestion you might have. The\neasiest way to reach us is using email.here\\@eurocontrol.int.\n\n## Other\n\nAlthough we cannot foresee when, or even if, the world will return to\nwhat it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to publish\nthis new edition of the standard inputs as a valuable source of inputs\nfor economic and cost-benefit analyses in aviation. The recommended\nvalues are often based on 2019 statistics and data which do not yet take\naccount of the impact of the pandemic.\n\nFor this edition, the focus is on environmental values, a new value for\nairports, turn-around time, and the introduction of two values related\nto drones. Drones represent a highly complex and fast-moving market,\nwhich makes forecasting more difficult than legacy aviation sectors.\nSuggestions for improvement and collaboration are welcome. Please send\nthem to aviation.intelligence\\@eurocontrol.int.\n\nWe would like to make a special mention of the launch of the EUROCONTROL\nAviation Intelligence Portal, which provides valuable and up-to-date\ninformation for economic analyses (https://ansperformance.eu/). The\nPortal will soon include the standard inputs (2021) and more information\nof use for cost-benefit analyses.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"link-external-filter":"^(?:http:|https:)\\/\\/ansperformance\\.eu\\/|^(?:http:|https:)\\/\\/.*ace-handbook\\.netlify\\.app\\/"},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["style.css"],"include-in-header":["media/fontawesome.html","media/analytics.html"],"output-file":"foreword.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","params":{"release_version":"10.0.1"},"bibliography":["bibliography.bib"],"biblio-style":"apalike","link-citations":true,"cover-image":"cover.png","editor_options":{"markdown":{"wrap":72}}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":true,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"foreword.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"params":{"release_version":"10.0.1"},"bibliography":["bibliography.bib"],"biblio-style":"apalike","link-citations":true,"cover-image":"cover.png","colorlinks":true,"documentclass":"book","papersize":"a4","fontsize":"11pt","links-as-notes":true,"editor_options":{"markdown":{"wrap":72}}},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
