The view of airlines and passengers considering all causes of delay\n\n2.  The view of the Network Manager focusing on Air Traffic Flow\n    Management delays\n\n## EUROCONTROL recommended values\n\nBelow two different views are provided: first, the values recommended\nfor Airspace Users and Passengers, followed by a zoom-in to the purely\nATFM-related delays.\n\n### All causes of delay\n\nThe figure below presents an **overview of all causes of delay**\nreported by the airlines in 2020 and 2021. These figures are estimated\nby EUROCONTROL Central Office of Delay Analysis (CODA), and they are\ncalculated based on the comparison of the scheduled and actual flight\ntimings and can be used in studies that look into the different causes\nof flight delay experienced by passengers and airlines.\n\n\n![](figures/delay_causes.png){#all-causes-delay}\n\n*Source: EUROCONTROL CODA (2019) All-Causes Delay to Air Transport in\nEurope*[@coda2021]\n\n### ATFM delay\n\nLooking specifically into **ATFM delay**, the figure below shows the\ndaily traffic and traffic flow delay per flight (en-route and at\nairport) for the period 2012-2021. These figures are calculated by the\nNetwork Manager based on the flight plans and include the planned ATFM\ndelays due to the restrictions that may be applied in the airspace.\n\n\n![](figures/atfm_delay.png){#atfm-delay}\n\n\n*Source: EUROCONTROL (2022) Network Operations Report 2021*[@nm2022]\n\nThe flow management delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delay\nfrom all causes, and around half of all delay is reactionary (i.e.,\ndelay caused by late arrival of aircraft, crew, passengers or baggage\nfrom previous journeys) rather than primary (i.e., delay other than\nreactionary).\n\n## When to use the input?\n\nWe recommend using all causes of delay provided by CODA when analysing\nthe impacts on airlines or on passengers/society (e.g., an airline\nupgrading the avionics in their aircraft; airport expansion, etc.). On\nthe other hand, ATFM delay is recommended to be used when analysing\nprojects aiming at improving Flow Management.\n\n## Comment\n\nLooking at both figures above, it can be observed that the ATFM delay,\nboth at the airport and en-route, is higher when looking at the numbers\nprovided by the airlines rather than that observed by the Network\nManager. This occurs because the delay numbers provided by the Network\nManager account for the so-called planned delay due to restrictions in\nthe airspace, while the numbers provided by the airlines cover the total\ndelay they attribute to ATFM, irrespective from the restrictions or any\nplanned ATFM delays.\n\nAnother important point to take into consideration\nwhen analysing the recommended values is the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. Both, the all-causes delay and the ATFM delay were impacted by\nthe significant reduction in air traffic in 2020 and 2021, resulting\ninto a strong drop in the total delay duration. Thus, when looking into\nthese numbers it is equally important to consider the situation prior to\n2020.
