The document also gives details of the sources of information, and discusses the applicability and use of the values.\n\nThis document will remain a living document, and so comments and suggestions are very welcome. Readers are invited to send these to aviation.intelligence@eurocontrol.int.\n\n\n## Details per data item {.unlisted .unnumbered}\n\nFor each standard input, the following information is provided, where relevant.\n\n|      Section     |  Description |\n|:-----------------|:-------------|\n| Definition       | A statement which describes the concept. |\n| EUROCONTROL recommended value or source | One or a set of recommended values or sources put forward by EUROCONTROL for the specific indicator. |\n| Source and date | The source documents and their publication dates. |\n| Description     | Any relevant information or details regarding the standard input.
