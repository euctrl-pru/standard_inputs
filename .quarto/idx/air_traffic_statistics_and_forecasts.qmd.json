units.\n\n## EUROCONTROL recommended source\n\nSource\n:   EUROCONTROL Statistics and Forecasts Service (STATFOR)  \n    https://www.eurocontrol.int/forecasting\n\n\n## Description\n\nThe objective of the Statistics and Forecast (STATFOR) service is to provide statistics and forecasts on air traffic in Europe and to monitor and analyse the evolution of the air transport Industry.\n\nIt produces the following:\n\n* Seven-year forecasts\n  The 7-year forecasts give a comprehensive picture of anticipated\n  air traffic development in Europe for the next seven years.\n  They combine flight statistics with economic growth and models of\n  other industry drivers, including costs, airport capacity,\n  passenger numbers, load factors and aircraft size.\n  Using high- and low-growth scenarios, they present a likely range\n  for growth, to help planners manage risks.\n  We publish them biannually, in spring and autumn, covering flights,\n  and en route and terminal service units every year.\n* Twenty-year forecasts\n  The 20-year forecasts look at a range of distinct possible scenarios\n  for how the air traffic industry might look in 20 years’ time.\n  This allows a range of ‘what if?’ questions to be explored, for factors\n  inside the industry (e.g. the growth of small business jets,\n  or of point-to-point traffic) or outside the industry (e.g. the price\n  of oil or environmental constraints).\n  Twenty-year forecasts are usually published every two to three years.\n* Ad-hoc publications, such as the Challenges to Growth reports,\n  trends in air traffic studies and other analyses can be found\n  in the EUROCONTROL library: https://www.eurocontrol.int/library\n\nTraffic statistics and forecasts can be obtained directly from the \n**STATFOR Interactive Dashboard (SID)**: \nhttps://www.eurocontrol.int/dashboard/statfor-interactive-dashboard.\n\n\n## Related standard inputs\n\n[Medium-term capacity planning], [air traffic delay], [flow management
