The lowest level usually occurs in February.\n\n**Value 2** indicates an overall increase in flights of 0.8% in 2019\ncompared with 2018. Traditional scheduled traffic increased by 1.4% and\ncharter traffic by 2.7%, whilst business aviation decreased by 3% and\ncargo by 2.7%. Military traffic covering only those flights operating as\ngeneral air traffic (GAT) and excluding operational air traffic (OAT)\ndecreased by 4.7%.\n\n**Value 3** Of those aircraft which flew IFR in 2019, four hundred and\nthirty-six (436) different civil aircraft types operated in Europe in\n2019. Some 75% of the flights were carried out by the 20 aircraft types\ndisplayed.\n\n## Related standard inputs\n\n[IFR flight information per operator\nsegment](#ifr-flight-information-per-market-segment), \\[fleet age\\],\n\\[fleet size\\] and \\[fleet CNS capability\\].\n\n## Further reading\n\n**EUROCONTROL Performance Review Commission**<br> The Performance Review\nCommission publishes traffic analyses in the annual Performance Review\nreports (https://www.eurocontrol.int/prc/publications).\n\n## Comment\n\nThese traffic figures are from 2019 and do not yet reflect the impact of\nCOVID.
