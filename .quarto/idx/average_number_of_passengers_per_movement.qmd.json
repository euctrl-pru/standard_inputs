This provides air transport data for passengers (in numbers of passengers) and for freight and mail (in thousands of tonnes) as well as air traffic data for airports, airlines and aircraft. Data are transmitted to Eurostat by the Member States of the European Union as well as the candidate countries Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. The air transport data have been calculated using data collected at airports.\n\n\n## Other possible value\n\nValue\n:   \n    ```{r}\n    library(tibble)\n    library(gt)\n    tribble(\n      ~ year,
