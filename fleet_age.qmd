# Fleet age {#sec-fleet-age}

##	EUROCONTROL recommended values

This section refers to the age of the aircraft operating IFR flights in Europe.

### Age, number of aircraft and number of flights according to the aircraft build year.

The information presented in @tbl-build-year-fleet-age is derived from flight plans submitted to the EUROCONTROL Network Manager (NM) for flights in 2022. These aircraft were therefore active in European airspace at some point during that year. The information was analysed using the EUROCONTROL PRISME fleet database to derive the aircraft ages. These are an approximation, as the month of entry into service is not taken into account. Since the numbers are based on flight plans, they exclude aircraft which do not fly in controlled airspace and therefore do not submit flight plans to the NM. The 301 aircraft whose age was unknown were aircraft which are not recorded in the PRISME database. These are mostly privately owned aircraft or aircraft based outside Europe, together with some smaller aircraft not flying regularly in controlled airspace and some new aircraft which do not feature in the database.

### Average aircraft age per flight (EU-27+EFTA) 

@fig-average-aircraft-age shows the average aircraft age in years by EUROCONTROL market segment.

EUROCONTROL market segments were updated in 2022 and saw the “Traditional Scheduled” segment split into “Mainline” and “Regional” according to EUROCONTROL Market Segment Rules [@ectl:market:seg:2022].
:::

Low-cost carriers have the youngest fleet on average, at 9.1 years in 2022, while charter and all-cargo have much older fleets, at 22 years for all-cargo and 15.4 years for charter flights in 2022. The increase in market share of all-cargo and business aviation in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, has pushed the average age of the overall fleet up to 11.6 years in 2022.

### Commercial aircraft fleet by age of aircraft (EU-27+EFTA+UK) 

@fig-com-aircraft-fleet shows commercial aircraft fleet by age of aircraft.

EUROSTAT publishes annual statistics on commercial aircraft fleet by age of aircraft and country of operator/country of registration.

## When to use the inputs?

Depending on the market, an aircraft can remain in service for about 30 years. While an aircraft follows a specific maintenance cycle, its performance can degrade over time due to engine and aerodynamic deterioration, leading to additional CO2 emissions. Fleet renewal helps reduce aviation’s environmental impact as newer aircraft tend to be more fuel efficient and quieter, therefore the average age of the European fleet is a good indicator of its environmental performance.
