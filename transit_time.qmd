# Transit time

## EUROCONTROL Recommended Values

The transit time in a country represents the average time flown by aircraft controlled in this country over a year. @tbl-transit-time provides an overview of the average transit time per country in 2019. The data that was used to build this table can be accessed at the AIU portal. [@aiuportal]

```{r}
#| label: tbl-transit-time
#| tbl-cap: Average transit time per country

read_xlsx("data/transit_time.xlsx") %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(
    country = "State",
    time = "Transit time (minutes)"
  ) %>%
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("*Source: Provided by EUROCONTROL Performance Review Unit (PRU)*")

## Description

This metric is the ratio between the IFR ACC movements controlled and the total ACC flight hours controlled where:

* IFR ACC movements controlled is the number of flights that have been controlled over the year by the ACC in the specified country
* Total ACC flight-hours controlled is the sum of the flight-hours controlled over the year by the ACC. For a given flight the flight-hours controlled are computed using information available in the Network Manager database as the difference between the exit time and the entry time in the controlled airspace

In @tbl-transit-time the range of transit time values for the vast majority of ANSPs in Europe can be observed (*Note: the scope is limited to the 38 ANSPs reporting to the [Performance Review Commission](https://ansperformance.eu/about/prc/)*). The weighted average in terms of flight time is 22 minutes per ACC. A difference of 31 minutes between the highest (Portugal) and the lowest (Belgium) transit time can also be observed â€“ this represents a ratio of almost 5 or a Standard Deviation of around 8.

## When to use the input?

This input is recommended for those projects where the flying time in a giver country or a set of countries is key to the assessment. As an example, it has previously been used for several CNS-related studies, in particular when studying the cost of communication services that depend on connection times.

## Comments

The data was recorded by the Network Manager (NM) for the 38 ANSPs that were part of the ACE Report in 2019. [@ace2019] For a few ANSPs, the data reported show slight differences with the NM records, as ANSPs tend to communicate their own traffic data. The differences are explained by the different counting methodology in IFR airport movements for training flights.
