# Medium-term capacity planning {#sec-medium-term-capacity-planning}

## EUROCONTROL recommended sources

In this document, capacity planning represents the systematic determination of
resource requirements for the projected output over a specific period of time. 
It is a dynamic activity that relies on constantly changing data on the 
ATM network use, capacity forecasts, etc. 

Given this, below are presented the sources that are recommended to consult in 
order to obtain relevant up to date information on capacity planning.

* ***EUROCONTROL European Network Operations Plan 2022-2026 [@ectrl:nop:2022]***

    The European Network Operations Plan (NOP) provides a short- to medium-term outlook of the expected ATM network operations and performance at network and local level.

    It provides a detailed overview of capacity and flight efficiency enhancement measures planned at network level and by each Area Control Centre (ACC), a description of the airport performance assessment and improvement measures planned at airports generating a high level of delay, operational actions planned to be taken by the Network Manager and other stakeholders that would respond to the performance targets. Furthermore, it provides an assessment of the expected impact from these measures on the network.

* ***EUROCONTROL European Network Operations Plan (NOP) - Rolling Seasonal Plann [@ectrl:nop:rsp]***

    The European NOP Rolling Seasonal Plan is updated every Friday, focusing on the planning of the next six weeks and on the management of the execution and implementation of the 5-years NOP. Its aim is to facilitate ANSPs and airports planning to match traffic demand in a safe, efficient and coordinated manner by providing them with a consolidated European network view of the evolution of air traffic.
    
    More information about network performance (and access to dashboards and the archive) can be found at the [Network Performance page](https://www.eurocontrol.int/network-performance).

* ***European ATM Master Plan - implementation plan – level 3 [@ectrl:mp:ip] and European ATM Master Plan – implementation report – level 3 [@ectrl:mp:ir]***

    The [**European ATM Master Plan**](https://www.eurocontrol.int/portal/european-atm-master-plan-portal)  is the main planning tool for setting ATM priorities, ensuring that the SESAR target concept becomes a reality. It is an evolving roadmap and the result of collaboration between all ATM stakeholders. The Master Plan provides a high-level view of what needs to be done in order to deliver a high-performing ATM system, while also explaining why and by when. It sets the framework for the development activities carried out by the SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) and deployed by stakeholders in partnership with the SESAR Deployment Manager (SDM).
    
    The **European ATM Master Plan - implementation plan – level 3** is produced annually and provides the framework for the commonly agreed actions to be taken by ECAC stakeholders, in the context of the implementation of the SESAR Programme.
    
    These actions are consolidated in implementation objectives, addressing elements in SESAR which have reached the necessary operational and technical maturity and for which stakeholders have expressed an interest in their operational introduction. They provide all civil and military implementing parties (ANSPs, airport operators, airspace users and regulators) with a basis for short- to medium-term implementation planning.
    
    The **European ATM Master Plan - implementation report – level 3** maps the evolution of the Master Plan implementation on the four phases of the SESAR vision, as defined in the 2020 edition of the Executive view of the Master Plan, for the delivery of a Digital European Sky.
    
    The Implementation Objectives constitute the backbone of the Level 3 and provide all civil and military implementing parties with a basis for short- to medium-term implementation planning. It also serves as a reference for States/National Supervisory Authorities (NSAs) to fulfil their roles regarding the supervision of safe and efficient provision of air navigation services as well as the timely implementation of SESAR.

* ***Local Single Sky ImPlementatiom (LSSIP) documents*** [@ectrl:lssip]

    The Local Single Sky ImPlementation (LSSIP) documents give a comprehensive overview of all ATM information for each of the ECAC Member States. They also show the ATM capacity forecasts and planning targets from NOP. The documents reflect progress made and detail the plans for each State for the next five to seven years.
    
    LSSIP documents, one for each State, are derived from the European Single Sky Implementation (ESSIP) (also known as Master Plan Level 3) objectives, and stakeholder lines of action cascade down into the States.
