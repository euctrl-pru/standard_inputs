# Value of a statistical injury {#sec-value-of-statistical-injury}

The value of a statistical injury represents the **monetary value of an improvement in safety to achieve a risk reduction which would prevent one statistical injury.** 
It can be used as a proxy to monetise the impact of an injury resulting from 
transport accidents.

[@tbl-value-of-injury] shows the estimation of the value of an injury as a fraction of
the value of statistical life, following the approach and numbers presented in 
the Handbook on the external costs of transport . This approach assumes six
levels of injury, where MAIS 1 and MAIS 2 represent slight injury, MAIS 3 through
MAIS 5 represent serious injury and MAIS 6 represents fatality.

Thus, in the table are presented the levels of injury, the share that the value 
of injury represents from the value of life and the calculated cost of injury in
euros, based on these percentages and the estimated value of statistical life as 
presented in [@sec-value-of-a-statistical-life].
