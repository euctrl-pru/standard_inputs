## Description

The Report on the Operation of the Route Charges System is published by the CRCO 
on an annual basis and provides data on traffic volumes and ATM costs for the 
States for which the CRCO collects en route and terminal charges.

[@tbl-distance-per-charging-zone] sets out the number of millions of kilometers
recorded in the airspace of the Contracting States from 2014 to 2022 for the 
calculation of route charges (great circle distance after deduction of 20 km for
departing and arriving flights) as well as the average annual variation observed 
during the same period.

Information on the various different charges levied by the CRCO, in particular 
the charge calculation methods, the basic billing documents, the methods of
payment and the submission of claims is described in [Customer Guide to Charges](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/customer-guide-route-charges).
