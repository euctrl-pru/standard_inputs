The results are based on the UK CAA departing passenger survey, which is carried 
out at selected airports (Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton, Stansted and Manchester), 
usually every year but interrupted from March 2020 onwards due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scope of the statistics is travel to, from and within the UK. Over a five-year 
period (2015 – 2019). 

The Holidays purpose of travel increased by 4 percentage points (p.p.) and Visiting
friends and relatives was up 2 p.p. On the other hand, Business travel went down 
by 2 p.p. and Miscellaneous decreased by 5 p.p.
