This is a prototype for *Standard Inputs for EUROCONTROL Cost-Benefit Analyses*.
It is based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

## TODO's

* [ ] define a LaTeX book template, see https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/book
* [ ] cover page, see maybe https://github.com/martinhelso/mnfrontpage
* [ ] document metadata page
* [ ] approval page: maybe just insert a PDF page using `prdfpages` (see prebody.tex)
* [ ] add PDF metadata info via `hyperref`
