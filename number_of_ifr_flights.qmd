## Description

**Value 1** shows the typical fluctuation in traffic during the year,
peaking in July and August. The lowest level usually occurs in February.

**Value 2** indicates an overall increase in flights of 0.8% in 2019
compared with 2018.
Traditional scheduled traffic increased by 1.4% and charter traffic by 2.7%,
whilst business aviation decreased by 3% and cargo by 2.7%.
Military traffic covering only those flights operating as general air
traffic (GAT) and excluding operational air traffic (OAT) decreased by 4.7%.

**Value 3** Of those aircraft which flew IFR in 2019, four hundred and
thirty-six (436) different civil aircraft types operated in Europe in 2019.
Some 75% of the flights were carried out by the 20 aircraft types displayed.
