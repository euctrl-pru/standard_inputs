EUROCONTROL market segments were updated in 2022 and saw the “Traditional Scheduled” segment split into “Mainline” and “Regional”. EUROCONTROL [Market Segment Rules](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/market-segment-rules).  

In 2021 the total number of flights went up 25.1% compared to 2020,but was at 56% of 2019 flight levels (pre-COVID-19)., Compared with 2019, only two segments increased in 2021 and they were All-Cargo (+14%) and Business Aviation (+3.8%). The Mainline (-54.5%), Low-Cost (-53.9%) and Regional (-47.6%) segments were the most affected along with the Charter segments which went down -20.6% in 2021 (vs 2019).

    low-cost, all-cargo and business aviation types of flights:
    https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/market-segment-rules\]

## Description

**Value 1** shows the typical fluctuation in traffic during the year,
peaking in July and August. The lowest level usually occurs in February.

**Value 2** indicates an overall increase in flights of 0.8% in 2019
compared with 2018. Traditional scheduled traffic increased by 1.4% and
charter traffic by 2.7%, whilst business aviation decreased by 3% and
cargo by 2.7%. Military traffic covering only those flights operating as
general air traffic (GAT) and excluding operational air traffic (OAT)
decreased by 4.7%.

**Value 3** Of those aircraft which flew IFR in 2019, four hundred and
thirty-six (436) different civil aircraft types operated in Europe in
2019. Some 75% of the flights were carried out by the 20 aircraft types
displayed.
