These aircraft were therefore active in European airspace at some point during that year. The information was analysed using the EUROCONTROL PRISME fleet database to derive the aircraft ages.\n\nSince the numbers are based on flight plans, they exclude aircraft which do not fly in controlled airspace and therefore do not submit flight plans to the NM. The 301 aircraft whose age was unknown were aircraft which are not recorded in the PRISME database. These are mostly privately owned aircraft or aircraft based outside Europe, together with some smaller aircraft not flying regularly in controlled airspace and some new aircraft which do not feature in the database.\n\n### Average aircraft age per flight (EU27+EFTA^[European Free Trade Association whose Member States comprise Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland]) \n\n@fig-average-aircraft-age shows the average aircraft age in years by EUROCONTROL market segment[@ectl:market:seg:2022] for the aircraft operating in 2022.\n \n![Average aircraft age per flight in EU27 + EFTA[@ectrl:statfor:sid]](../figures/aircraft_age_per_flight.svg){#fig-average-aircraft-age}\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nEUROCONTROL market segments were updated in 2022 and saw the “Traditional Scheduled” segment split into “Mainline” and “Regional” according to EUROCONTROL Market Segment Rules.[@ectl:market:seg:2022]\n:::\n\nLow-cost carriers have the youngest fleet on average, at 9.1 years in 2022, while charter and all-cargo have much older fleets, at 22 years for all-cargo and 15.4 years for charter flights in 2022. The increase in market share of all-cargo and business aviation in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, has pushed the average age of the overall fleet up to 11.6 years in 2022.\n\n### Commercial aircraft fleet by age of aircraft\n\n@fig-com-aircraft-fleet shows the commercial aircraft fleet size by age of aircraft.\n\n![Average aircraft age per flight  (EU27+EFTA+UK)[@eurostataircraftfleet]](../figures/aircraft-fleet-by-age.svg){#fig-com-aircraft-fleet}\n\n\nEUROSTAT publishes annual statistics on commercial aircraft fleet by age of aircraft and country of operator/country of registration.\n\n## When to use the inputs?\n\nDepending on the market, an aircraft can remain in service for about 30 years. While an aircraft follows a specific maintenance cycle, its performance can degrade over time due to engine and aerodynamic deterioration, leading to additional CO~2~ emissions. Fleet renewal helps reduce aviation’s environmental impact as newer aircraft tend to be more fuel efficient and quieter, therefore the average age of the European fleet is a good indicator of its environmental performance.\n\n## Related inputs\n\n@sec-number-of-ifr-flights [Number of IFR flights](#sec-number-of-ifr-flights)\n\n@sec-fleet-size [Fleet size](#sec-fleet-size)\n\n## References",
