Additional airports located in ECAC Member States were included \nin the airport list in order to scope all airports for which the EUROCONTROL PRU \nprovided operational data.\n\n**Step 2:** the data obtained in step 1 was sorted into brackets according to \nthe number of annual IFR movements, based on which the airports were allocated \nto categories, ranging from Small to Very large.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nPlease note that, within the category “Other”, on top of the 873 airports \npresented in fig-airport-classification, there are also 36 airports with no \nmovements recorded in 2022.\n\nStatistics on individual airport movements and operations at airports can be \ndownloaded from [Aviation Intelligence Unit Dashboard](https://ansperformance.eu/data/).\n:::\n\n## Other possible sources\n\nInformation on airports that have implemented a collaborative decision-making (A-CDM) \ncan be found [via this link](https://www.eurocontrol.int/concept/airport-collaborative-decision-making). \n\nAirport CDM aims to improve the overall efficiency of airport operations by \noptimising the use of resources and improving the predictability of events. \nIt focuses especially on aircraft turnaround and pre-departure sequencing processes.\n\nThe A-CDM concept has been globally recognised. A-CDM is fully implemented in 32 \nairports across Europe (status: December 2020), including Amsterdam, Barcelona,\nBergamo, Berlin Brandenburg “Willy Brandt”, Brussels, Copenhagen, Düsseldorf, \nFrankfurt, Geneva, Hamburg, Helsinki, Lisbon, London Gatwick, London Heathrow, \nLyon, Madrid, Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Munich, Naples, Nice, Paris CDG, \nParis Orly, Oslo, Palma de Mallorca, Prague, Rome Fiumicino, Stockholm Arlanda,\nStuttgart, Venice, Warsaw, and Zurich.\n\nMore details for a selected airport are available in EUROCONTROL Public Airport Corner.[@apt:corner]\n\n## Comment\n\nThe mapping of airports to categories in the recommended value is purely indicative\nand is based on the situation in 2022. The local situation of many airports may \nnot be known or be interpreted differently. Final applicability of the assigning\nof airports to categories needs to be checked and confirmed by the appropriate \nairport or authority.\n\n## Related inputs\n\n@sec-turnaround-time [Turnaround time](#sec-turnaround-time)\n\n## References\n\n",
