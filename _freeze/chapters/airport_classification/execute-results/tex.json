Here we focus on categorisation of\nairports according to the number of IFR movements.\n\nThe list of airports used for this classification was developed using a two-step \nprocedure: \n\n**Step 1:** The initial worldwide airport list provided by the EUROCONTROL \nPerformance Review Unit (PRU) was restricted to airports located in ECAC Member \nStates and having both ICAO and IATA codes, in order to focus on airports providing \ncommercial air transport services (1 079 airports). \n\n**Step 2:** Seventy-seven airports located in ECAC Member States were added to\nthe airport list in order to scope all airports for which the EUROCONTROL PRU\nprovided operational data.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nStatistics on individual airport movements and operations at Airports can be \ndownloaded from the Aviation Intelligence Unit Dashboard.[@aiuportal]\n:::\n\n## Other possible sources\n\nInformation on airports that have implemented a collaborative decision-making (A-CDM) \ncan be found [via this link](https://www.eurocontrol.int/concept/airport-collaborative-decision-making). \n\nAirport CDM (A-CDM) aims to improve the overall efficiency of airport operations\nby optimising the use of resources and improving the predictability of events. \nIt focuses especially on aircraft turnaround and pre-departure sequencing processes.\n\nThe A-CDM concept has been globally recognised. A-CDM is fully implemented in 30 \nairports across Europe (status: December 2020), including Amsterdam, Barcelona,\nBergamo, Berlin Brandenburg \"Willy Brandt\", Brussels, Copenhagen, DÃ¼sseldorf, \nFrankfurt, Geneva, Hamburg, Helsinki, Lisbon, London Gatwick, London Heathrow, \nLyon, Madrid, Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Munich, Naples, Nice, Paris CDG, \nParis Orly, Oslo, Palma de Mallorca, Prague, Rome Fiumicino, Stockholm Arlanda, \nStuttgart, Venice, Warsaw and Zurich.\n\nMore details for a selected airport are available in the EUROCONTROL Public Airport Corner.[@apt:corner]\n\n## Comments\n\nThe mapping of airports to categories in the recommended value is purely indicative\nand is based on the situation in 2018. The mapping of airports will most probably \nchange significantly as a result of COVID from 2020 onwards. The local situation\nof many airports may not be known or be interpreted differently. Final applicability \nof the assigning of airports to categories needs to be checked and confirmed by \nthe appropriate airport or authority.\n\n## Related inputs\n\n@sec-turnaround-time [Turnaround time](#sec-turnaround-time)\n\n## References\n\n",
