It is essentially the **opportunity cost which corresponds to the monetary value associated with a passenger during a journey.** It shows how much a passenger would be willing to pay in order\nto save time during a journey (e.g. by travelling on a quicker service\nor using a faster transport mode), or how much 'compensation' they would\naccept, directly or indirectly, for lost time lost.\n\nIn [@tbl-pas-value-of-time] is presented a collection of the different values that can be used\nfor this purpose. It is to be noted that, in this section, the value of\ntime is not cited as a function of delay duration. This is an important\nconsideration when using the value. In this case, the longer the delay\nduration, the higher the value.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-pas-value-of-time .cell tbl-cap='Estimated value of travel time'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{lc}\n\\toprule\nTravel purpose & Time value (€/hour)\\textsuperscript{1} \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{United Kingdom} \\\\ \n\\midrule\nLeisure & $\\text{EUR}8.60$ \\\\ \nUK business & $\\text{EUR}63.80$ \\\\ \nForeign business & $\\text{EUR}60.70$ \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{France} \\\\ \n\\midrule\nPersonal - holiday & $\\text{EUR}59.80$ \\\\ \nPersonal - other & $\\text{EUR}61.20$ \\\\ \nBusiness & $\\text{EUR}83.50$ \\\\ \nAll purpose & $\\text{EUR}62.10$ \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{2}{l}{EU25 average} \\\\ \n\\midrule\nPersonal & $\\text{EUR}20.47$ \\\\ \nBusiness & $\\text{EUR}49.98$ \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\textsuperscript{1}Please note that the values above are adjusted to 2022 prices based on inflation as follows: for United Kingdom adjusted from 2014 prices; for France adjusted from 2015 prices; for EU25 average adjusted from 2002 prices\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n*Sources: United Kingdom[@aptcom2014]; France[@frminecotra2019]; EU25 average[@heatco2006]*\n\n## When to use the input?\n\nThis input is expected to become useful in any study that looks at the \nopportunity cost of the use of air transport, delays, cancellations, etc. \nIt provides a perspective on the impact that a change in the air transport\ncan have on the passenger.\n\n## Comments\n\nWhen looking into the values in the table, a few points regarding the sources \nshould be taken into consideration:\n\n* The source used for the UK values sets out a methodology for analysis which \nhas been undertaken to estimate benefits from reduced delay time to airlines \nand passengers from changes in aviation capacity constraints in the UK for 11 \nairports. \n\n* The values for France rely on a working paper on recommended values for\ncalculating the components of a socio-economic net present value, which include \ntravel time. The assessment therefore covers social, environmental and economic \neffects.\n\n* Regarding the numbers for EU25, they remain a reference if a European value is\nsought. The objective of the study from which they were derived is to propose \nharmonised guidelines for project assessment for transnational projects in\nEurope. It provides monetary estimates for the values of time saved for \nemployer’s business and for passenger non-work trips (e.g. commuting, shopping\nand leisure).\n\n## Other values to consider\n\nSome additional values are available to EUROCONTROL, which, although not \nconstituting the perceived key inputs, may be useful for specific purposes of \nthe user of these inputs. These values are presented below.\n\n***Value of time of a business aviation passenger***\n\n**€153 per hour.** This value was provided to EUROCONTROL by airline members of \nthe SESAR CBA team in 2012. This value is, therefore adjusted form 2011 prices. \nRationale: given that typical business jet passengers are high level\nexecutives/CEOs, the passenger cost for lost time adapted from Eurostat was \nestimated as being three times the value of a regular flyer.\n\n## References\n\n[@itf:2019] [@passtimevalue2015] [@leedsuniversity2016] [@leedsuniversity2012]\n",
