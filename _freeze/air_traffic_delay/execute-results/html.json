It is based on delay data provided directly by airlines.\nThis data on all causes of delay is derived by airlines, comparing actual\ntimings with their published schedules.\n\nStatistics on all causes of delay can be obtained directly from the\nCODA Interactive Dashboard (CID) (a request for access is required).\nThis dashboard aims to provide the user with an enhanced understanding of\nthe causes of delay to flights, both that relating to air traffic flow\nmanagement (ATFM) and non-ATFM-related delay.\nATFM delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delays from all causes, and\naround half of all delay is reactionary rather than primary.\nAnalyses within the dashboard are based on flight-by-flight data provided by\nairspace users as well as the Network Manager.\n\nMore information about CODA can be found at\nhttps://www.eurocontrol.int/network-performance (go to CID).\n\n\n## Related standard inputs\n\n[Air traffic statistics and forecast](#air-traffic-statistics-and-forecasts),\n[flow management delay] and [cost of delay].\n\n",
