ROIC is calculated before payments of debt interest and shows the earnings available to pay both debt and equity investors. Furthermore, the calculation excludes fuel and labour related benefits. The estimated profits of the fuel supply chain round € 11-35 billion per year globally. The vast majority of these profits are allocated with the crude oil suppliers.\n\n**Wider economic benefits** represent those that go beyond the direct impact on the users, such as any spillover effects from in increased competition and more efficient movement of capital and labour. \n\nOne of the largest economic benefits of increased connectivity comes from its impact on the long term productivity of the wider economy. There are several approaches which may be used to quantify this benefit. One conservative approach which has been developed, on the basis of the statistical relationship between air connectivity and labour productivity, yields an estimate that a **10% rise in connectivity, relative to a country’s GDP, will boost labour productivity levels by 0.07%.**\n\n## When to use the input?\n\nThe use of these values depends on the scope and the viewpoint of the analysis. For example, an assessment from the point of view of airlines will focus on the benefits that an additional flight brings to airlines, whereas an analysis from the perspective of a government or the European Commission should also include an assessment of benefits for consumers and the wider economy.\n\nNote also that these values reflect the market conditions and the passenger demand at the time of the study. For example, changes in passengers’ income, changes in their preferences for air transport or changes in airlines’ market structure can affect these values.\n\n",
