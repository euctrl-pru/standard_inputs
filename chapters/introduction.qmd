# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This document provides a set of data commonly used in economic and financial 
analyses and appraisals, particularly in the field of ATM.

The aim of this document is to standardise the data used in different ATM-related 
assessments, to facilitate data access for the different stakeholders involved 
and contribute to the comparability of different analyses through relying on the same data.

In this edition (10.0) the values have been updated according to the latest 
available information, either by adding new data or by adjusting existing data 
for inflation, where relevant.

Please note that the inputs have been compiled from EUROCONTROL data and intelligence,
from values provided by airspace users, ANSPs, airports, IATA, EASA, and other 
organisations, and from other relevant documents which are publicly available.

The inputs are average values and may not be appropriate in all circumstances. 
The document also gives details of the sources of information and discusses the 
applicability and use of the values.


This document will remain a living document, and so comments and suggestions
are welcome. Readers are invited to send these to [{{< var email.info >}}](mailto:{{< var email.info >}}).
