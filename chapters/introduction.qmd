# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This document provides a set of data commonly used in economic and financial 
analyses and appraisals, particulary in the field of ATM.

The aim of this document is to standardise the data used in the different 
ATM-related assessments, facilitate the data access for the different stakeholders
involved and contribute to the comparability of different analyses through relying on the same data.

In this edition ({{< meta release-version >}}) the values have been updated 
according to the latest available information, either by adding new data or by
adjusting existing data to inflation, where relevant.

Please note that the standard inputs have been compiled from EUROCONTROL data 
and intelligence, from values provided by airspace users, ANSPs, airports, IATA,
EASA and other organisations, and from other relevant documents which are publicly available.

They are average values and may not be appropriate in all circumstances. 
The document also gives details of the sources of information, and discusses 
the applicability and use of the values.

This document will remain a living document, and so comments and suggestions
are welcome. Readers are invited to send these to [{{< var email.aiu >}}](mailto:{{< var email.aiu >}}).
