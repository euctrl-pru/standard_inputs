According to [EUROCONTROL Specification for Operational ANS Performance Monitoring - Air Transport Operator Data Flow](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/eurocontrol-specification-aodf), 
which is referenced in [Commission Implementing Regulation EU No 2019/317](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ%3AL%3A2019%3A056%3ATOC&uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2019.056.01.0001.01.ENG) 
as a document containing the provisions for information that needs to be provided
by the airlines, an ‘operational cancellation’ refers to a scheduled arrival or
departure flight to which the following conditions apply:

* the flight received an airport slot (if the airport is subject to slot coordination), and

* the flight was confirmed by the air carrier the day before operations and/or 
  it was contained in the daily list of flight schedules produced by the airport 
  operator the day before operations, but
  
* the actual landing or take-off never occurred.

Reports about all causes of delay (and cancellation up to 2019) are available in the [EUROCONTROL library](https://www.eurocontrol.int/library).

In 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic strongly influenced the entire aviation industry 
with more than double the cancellation rate seen in 2019.
