## EUROCONTROL recommended values

The tables below present an overview of the **average cost per minute to the airline of ground or airborne delay of a commercial passenger flight**. Please note that all the numbers are based on studies performed by the 
University of Westminster [@uow:2004] [@uow:2015] and are adjusted to 2022 prices based on
[inflation](#tbl-inflation-table).

The figures presented in this section constitute high-level averages and are
valid as indicative estimates. **It is strongly recommended that they are used as indicators or for general insights into delay costs and not for specific analyses or operational planning.** 
Different values may be obtained for other contexts 
(e.g. other airspace areas or airports (hub or non-hub), etc.), with different 
aircraft and delay distributions.

On top of the above, the **network average cost of ATFM delay^[ATFM delay is defined as the duration between the last take-off time requested by the aircraft operator and the take-off slot allocated by the Network Manager following a regulation communicated by the flow management position (FMP), in relation to an airport (airport ATFM delay) or sector location (en route ATFM delay)] amounts €100 per minute.**

The University of Westminster (UoW) report, published in 2004 and updated in 2011 
and 2015, represents the most recent and comprehensive appraisal of the cost of 
delay in the air traffic management system in Europe. The report is designed as 
a reference document for European delay direct costs incurred by airlines, both 
at strategic (planning) and tactical stages. 

It contains a detailed assessment of the delay cost for 15 specific aircraft types 
(extended from 12 in the previous report versions), taking into account crew, 
fuel, fleet, maintenance and passenger additional costs due to delay. Note that 
the list of aircraft used for this report does not include some recent types such 
as Airbus NEO Series, A220, A350 or B787. 

In the study, costs are assigned under three cost scenarios: low, base and high. 
These scenarios are designed to cover the probable range of costs for European 
operators. The base cost scenario is, to the greatest extent possible, designed 
to reflect the typical case and is, therefore, the one used in this value.

The University of Westminster report presents costs of delay in four flight 
phases: at gate, taxiing, en-route (cruise extension) and arrival management. 
For accuracy reasons, the definitions used by the University of Westminster are
presented as such. They are extracted from the UoW 2004 and 2011 reports.

## Flight phases, types of delay costs and calculation method used

A description of the flight phases, types of delay costs and the calculation 
method used in the study are given hereafter.

![Overview of the different flight phases](../figures/flight_phases.png){#fig-flight-phases}

***Types of delay costs***

* Tactical delay costs are incurred on the day of operations. In most cases, it 
is anticipated that the user will find it appropriate to use the full tactical 
costs in order to calculate these costs of delay. These include the reactionary 
costs of ‘knock-on’ delay in the rest of the network, which it is usually pertinent to include.

* Strategic delay costs are accounted for in advance. Strategic costs are typically 
used to assess the cost of adding buffers to schedules. This could be by airline 
choice or imposed by scheduling constraints at an airport (and thus considered a
cost of congestion, albeit one which offsets tactical delay costs). Strategic 
costs may also be incurred as a consequence of factors which contribute to an 
increase in flight time in a predictable way, such as delay due to route design. 

***Calculation method***

The tactical and strategic delay costs referred to in @tbl-delay-cost-tact and @tbl-delay-cost-strat are 
calculated based on the results extracted from the University of Westminster (UoW) 
study report “European airline delay cost reference values – Updated and extended 
values Version 4.1” – December 2015. Explicit cost tables for analytical use 
(up to 30 minutes of delay) are presented at the end of this section. The extended
tables can be found in the UoW report mentioned above.

As regards tactical delay costs, these are given for 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180,
240 and 300 minutes in the UoW report. These are scaled up to network level, 
because on the day of operations, original delays caused by one aircraft cause 
‘knock-on’ effects in the rest of the network (reactionary delays). 

Based on at-gate data provided by the Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA) 
on ranges of departure delays  by aircraft type for year 2014, assumptions have 
been made for the remaining three flight phases (i.e. taxi, en-route and arrival 
management). The same delay distribution has been used as an assumption applicable 
to all flight phases.

The UoW results have been averaged by minute of delay per type of aircraft 
(15 in total) and further weighted by the distribution of the number of delayed 
flights per delay range, at departure, carried out by these aircraft in 2014.

Consequently, for each flight phase, two types of values have been calculated: 

1.	one taking into account long delays (i.e. 0 to more than 300 minutes)

2.	one taking into account short delays (i.e. up to 30 minutes), which represent about 90% of all delays

As regards strategic delay, since costs at the strategic level are incorporated
into the aircraft operator’s schedule in advance, they are associated with average 
costs and, therefore, only a distribution of the number of flights was applied 
in order to calculate the strategic high-level averages.

## Use of costs in business cases

When comparing two scenarios, it is not correct to calculate the delay avoided as a benefit without taking into account the corresponding marginal cost of capacity. In other words, there is a delay threshold below which the marginal cost of capacity outweighs the delay avoidance benefit.

Every CBA should carefully consider whether the improvements envisaged by the project are of a tactical or strategic nature. For the correct use and precise understanding of the tactical and strategic delay concepts, see section 4 of and Annex I to the 2004 University of Westminster delay study.
