# Transit time {#sec-transit-time}

## EUROCONTROL Recommended Values

The transit time in an ANSP represents the **average time flown by aircraft controlled in this airspace over a year**. 
@tbl-transit-time provides an overview of the average transit 
time (expressed in minutes) per ANSP in 2019.

The data that was used to build this table, as well as more recent data, can be accessed on AIU portal.[@aiuportal]

## Description

This metric is the ratio between the total flight hours controlled and the IFR 
flights controlled, where: 

* Total IFR flight-hours controlled is the sum of the flight-hours controlled 
over the year by the ANSP. For a given flight the flight-hours controlled are 
computed using information available in the Network Manager database as the 
difference between the exit time and the entry time in the controlled airspace

* •	IFR movements controlled is the number of flights that have been controlled
over the year by the ANSP

In @fig-transit-time, the range of transit time values for the vast majority of 
ANSPs in Europe can be observed (Note: the scope is limited to the 38 ANSPs 
reporting to the [Performance Review Commission](https://ansperformance.eu/about/prc/)).
The European average in terms 
of flight time is 31 minutes per ANSP. A difference of 49 minutes between the 
highest (DHMI Türkiye) and the lowest (M-NAV North Macedonia) transit time can
also be observed – this represents a ratio of almost 6 or a Standard Deviation 
of around 12.

## When to use the input?

This input is recommended for those projects where the flying time in a giver
country or a set of countries is key to the assessment. As an example, it has 
previously been used for several CNS related studies, in particular when studying 
the cost of communication services that depend on connection times.

## Comments

The data was recorded by the Network Manager (NM) for the 38 ANSPs that were part
of the ACE Report in 2019 [@ace2019]. For a few ANSPs, the data reported show 
slight differences with the NM records, as ANSPs tend to communicate their own 
traffic data. The differences are explained by the different counting methodology 
in IFR airport movements for training flights.
