# Load factor – passengers {#sec-load-factor-passengers}

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

The load factor represents the percentage of seats filled by fare paying passengers
on a flight. @fig-load-factor-pax-ectrl shows the estimated passenger load factor according to
EUROCONTROL STATFOR values. These values were obtained by dividing the total number
of passengers by the total number of available seats on the flights. This information
is based on the data produced by Eurostat and covers the EU27+UK, and four European
Free Trade Association (EFTA) states.^[European Free Trade Association: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland]

@fig-load-factor-pax-iata presents the evolution in the passenger load factor according to IATA 
data. These values represent the ratio of revenue passenger km to available seat 
km. **The difference from values in @fig-load-factor-pax-ectrl is the geographical coverage:** IATA’s 
Europe area is larger than EU Europe statistical area used by STATFOR, it also 
covers countries such as Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

![Passenger load factor - IATA values^[The values used in this figure come from IATA monthly Air Passenger Market Analysis reports for the month of December of each year. The data is extracted from the table “Air passenger market detail”, looking at Total market in Europe, column PLF (level) for the calendar year.]](../figures/load-factor-pax-iata.svg){#fig-load-factor-pax-iata}
