# Air traffic statistics and forecasts {#sec-air-traffic-statistics-and-forecasts}

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

The [EUROCONTROL Statistics and Forecast (STATFOR)](https://www.eurocontrol.int/forecasting#tools) service produces flight and
service unit forecasts of future network traffic with a view to help planners
understand and manage risks, identify bottlenecks, and anticipate the needs of 
airspace users.

### Medium-term forecast (7-year timespan)

The medium-term forecasts give a comprehensive picture of **anticipated air traffic development in Europe (i.e. ECAC) for the next seven years.** These forecasts combine flight statistics with economic growth and models of other industry drivers, 
including costs, airport capacity, passenger numbers, load factors and aircraft 
size. Using high and low growth scenarios, they present a likely range for growth,
to help planners manage risks.

These forecasts are published biannually, in spring and autumn, covering flights,
en-route and terminal service units and the latest forecast can always be found
on the [STATFOR page](https://www.eurocontrol.int/forecasting#tools).

The above graph shows the traffic forecast taking account of the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In the base scenario, IFR flights are expected to be back to 
2019 levels by 2026. Traffic statistics and forecasts can be obtained directly 
from the STATFOR Interactive Dashboard (SID)[@ectrl:statfor:sid].

### Long-term forecast (20 to 30-year timespan)

Twenty to thirty-year forecasts look at a range of distinct possible scenarios 
for how the air traffic industry might look in 20-30 years’ time. 

This allows a range of *“what if?”* questions to be explored, for factors inside 
the industry (e.g. the growth of small business jets, or of point-to-point traffic)
or outside the industry (e.g. the price of oil or environmental constraints).

Twenty to thirty-year forecasts are usually published every two to three years. 
In April 2022, EUROCONTROL published its first EUROCONTROL Aviation Outlook (EAO)
looking out to 2050, much further than previous forecasts. This forecast estimates
a future number of flights and CO~2~ emissions per scenario, in line with aviation’s
objective of achieving net-zero CO~2~ emissions by that date.


![Flight forecast for Europe, with total growth between 2024 and 2050](../figures/eao_2050_flights_base_scenario.png){#fig-Forecast-2050-plot}

**In the most-likely Base scenario, the forecast is for 15.4 million flights in Europe in 2050, 39% more than in 2019 – average growth of 1.1% per year.**

Furthermore, @fig-co2-emissions-plot shows the estimated evolution of CO~2~ emissions
between 2005 and 2050. According to this data, by 2050, CO~2~ emissions, net of 
sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), fleet and operational improvements, will be 
reduced by about 63% compared to the baseline in the Base scenario.

### Service units forecasts

Service Units are billed to airlines for the provision of air-traffic services. 
They are of two types:

* En-route Traffic Service Units (TSU) that are taxed for the provision of 
en-route air traffic control and are a function of the weight and the distance
flown within each state over which the concerned aircraft flies.

* Terminal Navigation Service Units (TNSU) are taxed for the provision of ground 
services to the airlines for each departure at a given airport. They are a
function of the weight of the considered aircraft.

EUROCONTROL produces a 7-year forecast of Service Units that builds on the 7-year
IFR movements forecast, by adding forecasts of the aircraft weights and distances.
This Service Units forecast is provided to states that are part of the Central
Route Charges Office (CRCO) to help them set-up their en-route unit rates, if 
needed. The Forecast of Service Units in general serves also as a benchmark for 
the European Commission to assess the financial aspects of the performance plans
of the states that are bound by the Performance and Charging Schemes according 
to EU regulations (EU) N°2019/317.

The above graph shows the en-route service units forecast taking account of the impact of COVID-19.

## When to use the inputs?

The objective of STATFOR is to provide statistics and forecasts on IFR flight
movements and service units in Europe (ECAC) and to monitor and analyse the 
evolution of the air transport industry.
