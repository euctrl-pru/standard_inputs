## EUROCONTROL recommended sources

Drone fleet represents an estimate of the size of the future drone fleet 
operating in Europe. Below are presented some 
**key sources that can be consulted in order to obtain information about the drone fleet in Europe.**

* *SESAR Joint Undertaking (SJU) (2016), European Drones Outlook Study. Unlocking the value for Europe[@sju:drones2016]* 

  Describes the growing potential of the European market for drones. 
  The development of the drone fleet is dependent on the ability of the industry 
  to operate various areas of airspace. The document analyses the likely evolution of 
  the fleet, linking it with the expected use, whether for military, government and 
  commercial, or leisure purposes.

* *SJU (2018), European ATM Master Plan: Roadmap for the safe integration of drones into all classes of airspace[@sju:drones:2018]* 

  Outlines which drone related-research and development (R&D) activities should 
  be prioritised in order to support the expansion of the drone market and achieve
  the smooth, safe, and fair integration of these new aircraft systems into the 
  European airspace. It also provides an ambitious rollout plan for these technological
  developments. The document concentrates on the link with the Master Plan 2020 
  Business View and brings in the topic of urban air mobility.

::: {.callout-note}
In view of the rapid evolution in recent years, the role of drones is likely to 
expand more than the source documents consider. The fleet is rapidly growing, 
making outlook analyses unstable. The data provided in the source documents should
be seen as an estimate and will be reviewed in future editions of the standard 
inputs as additional data become available.
