The above values, provided by IATA, refer to the 2020 Airline Cost Management 
Group (ACMG) data collection (fiscal year 2019) and provide an overview of the
operating costs for 10 types of aircraft (B737 NG, A320 family, B737 Classic, 
B777, A330, B757, B767, B787, EMB-190 and Dash 8). The IATA ACMG collects 
operating costs classified into three categories. These categories are defined as follows:

* **Flight operating expenses** are direct operating expenses. They are directly
  related to the aircraft and the flight activities of an airline, such as flight 
  crew, fuel, flight equipment and navigation. The biggest component of flight 
  operating expenses is fuel and oil at 48%.

* **Ground operating expenses** are also direct operating expenses. They are 
  directly related to the ground activities of an airline, such as maintenance 
  and overhaul, airport charges, station, and ground. Maintenance and overhaul
  are the biggest cost component at 46%. 

* **System operating expenses** are overheads and indirect operating expenses. 
  They are not directly related to flight or ground operating expenses. They 
  include costs for cabin crew, passenger service, load insurance, reservations, 
  ticketing, sales, and promotion, IT and communications, and general and 
  administrative costs, with the latter representing 34% of total system operating expenses.

Below, the airline cost structure for each category of expenses (2019):

Airline cost structure

:::

![Airline Cost Structure](../figures/airline_cost_split.svg){#fig-airline-costs-split fig-align=center}

## Data scope

The values used for analysis are the result of aggregating the cost data 
provided by 51 airlines worldwide ($26.5 billion expenditure), covering over
35% of the industry in terms of revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs), with 
European airlines representing 16% of the share and 12% in terms of passengers carried.

## Data limitations

In a number of jurisdictions, airport charges and taxes that are levied on a 
per-passenger basis are not accounted for in airline profit and loss accounts. 
As a result, the share of airport charges is likely to be significantly understated, 
as airports may levy more on (i) a per-passenger or (ii) per-aircraft basis in 
some jurisdictions. To give an order of magnitude, in some regions the ACI 
(Airports Council International) estimates that over 50% of airport charges are 
collected on a per-passenger basis, reaching as much as 80% in some regions worldwide.
