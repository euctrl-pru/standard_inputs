The **Airbus Global Market Forecast for 2022-2041** presents a forward-looking 
view of the evolution of the air transport sector, accounting for factors such 
as demographic and economic growth, tourism trends, oil prices, the development 
of new and existing routes, and ultimately highlighting demand for aircraft 
covering the spectrum of sizes from 100 seats to the very largest aircraft of over 500 seats.

![Airbus commercial aircraft demand 2022-2041 @airbusGMF2022](../figures/airbus_demand.svg){#fig-airbus-demand}

As shown in @fig-airbus-demand, **for the years 2022-2041, Airbus forecasts a demand for 39,490 new commercial aircraft worldwide,**
of which 8,140 units (21%) are for Europe/CIS regions. Asia-Pacific, China and 
the US are driving the growth, while single-aisle aircraft dominate the demand (>80%).

**For the same period (2022-2041), Boeing forecasts a global demand for 40,170 new commercial aircraft**
of which 8,550 units (21%) are for Europe. Europe, Asia-Pacific, US, and China 
are the drivers for growth owing to the demand for single-aisle aircraft which 
represents between 69% (in US) and 82% (in Europe) of the total fleet forecast.
@fig-boeing-demand shows the Boeing forecast demand for new aircraft by category
and world regions with a focus on single-aisle aircraft which lead the market growth.
