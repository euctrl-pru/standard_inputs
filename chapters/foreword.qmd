# Foreword {.unnumbered}

The first version of the EUROCONTROL Standard Inputs for Economic Analyses series
was launched in 2002 and has been kept alive for more than twenty years. This 
latest edition is a continuation of the work developed over all these years and 
aims to update the inputs that have been previously published, but also to add new
inputs that are believed to be of interest for our stakeholders.

The previous editions of the Standard Inputs for Economic Analyses can be found in the "Previous Versions" tab on top of the page or in [EUROCONTROL Library](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/eurocontrol-standard-inputs-economic-analyses).

We, the EUROCONTROL Business Cases Team, would like to show our gratitude to the
many different colleagues that have contributed to this endeavour by providing us
data and helping develop the values. Trying to name them all would be impossible.

We have received valuable remarks and suggestions from all stakeholders in the 
aviation value chain. In particular, we have benefited from stakeholders involved 
in the entire development life cycle, from ideas to a working system. We strongly 
believe that this collaboration makes the EUROCONTROL Standard Inputs for Economic
Analyses a robust product.
