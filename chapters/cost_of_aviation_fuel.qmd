## EUROCONTROL recommended sources

The source recommended to consult for the latest data on the cost of aviation 
fuel is the [IATA Jet Fuel Price Monitor](https://www.iata.org/en/publications/economics/fuel-monitor/).

On its website, IATA provides jet fuel prices for the major regions of the world,
together with analysis and commentary. The values are based on [Platts Energy Market Data](http://www.platts.com/).

When estimating the jet fuel price, consideration should be given to the selection
of the geographical area, and hence currency, as a change in oil price can have 
a different effect on the jet fuel price owing to currency fluctuations, e.g. 
the downturn in the euro in 2015.

The ‘spread’ between the aviation fuel price and the underlying oil price covers
the cost of refining, but it can vary significantly with time depending on underlying 
demand (e.g. from consumers needing a similar fraction to aviation), and on supply
problems (such as a breakdown at a refinery or increasing local prices relative to oil).
