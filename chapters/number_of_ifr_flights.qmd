# Number of IFR flights {#sec-number-of-ifr-flights}

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

This section presents the evolution of flight movements in Europe (ECAC area) 
by flight flow, market segment^[The market segments are defined according to [EUROCONTROL STATFOR Market Segment Rules](https://www.eurocontrol.int/publication/market-segment-rules). Please refer to the 2022 document for further details on what each segment comprises.]  and aircraft type.

Please note that the comparison between 2022 and 2019 in @tbl-ifr-flights-month 
is due to the fact that 2019 is the last year where the traffic levels were not
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for a more realistic comparison of 
the flight levels.

In 2022 the total number of flights went up by 48% compared to 2021 but was at 
83% of 2019 flight levels (pre-COVID-19). Compared with 2019, two segments 
increased in 2022, All-Cargo (+6%) and Business Aviation (+16%). The Mainline 
(-25%), Low-Cost (-15%) and Regional (-26%) segments were the most affected, 
along with the Charter segment which went down by -15% in 2022 (vs 2019).

In 2022, about 76% of all IFR flights in Europe were carried out by the 20 
aircraft types listed in @tbl-flights-per-aircraft-type. Please note that the 
values presented in @tbl-flights-per-aircraft-type focus on the civil aviation 
flights (i.e. excluding the military and other categories), resulting in a difference
in the total flights as compared with @tbl-flights-per-market-segment and @tbl-ifr-flights-month.

### Daily average of IFR flights, 2016 to 2022

@fig-average-daily-ifr-flights-plot shows the daily average number of IFR flights **EU-wide**
between 2016 and 2022.

## When to use the input?

This input is recommended to be used in situations where an overview of the 
historical evolution in the number of flights is required, namely grouped 
according to different criteria.
