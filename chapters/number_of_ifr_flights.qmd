# Number of IFR flights {#sec-number-of-ifr-flights}

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

This section presents the evolution of flight movements in Europe (ECAC
area) by flight flow, market segment and aircraft type.

### Evolution of flights per flow in 2021 compared to 2019

```

Please note that the comparison between 2021 and 2019 in @tbl-ifr-flights-month is due to the fact that 2019 is the last year where the traffic levels were not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for a more realistic comparison of the flight levels.[@ectrl:statfor:sid]

### Flights by market segment in Europe (ECAC) in 2021 compared to 2019

EUROCONTROL market segments were updated in 2022 and saw the
"Traditional Scheduled" segment split into "Mainline" and "Regional" according to
EUROCONTROL Market Segment Rules [@ectl:market:seg:2022].

In 2021 the total number of flights went up 25.1% compared to 2020, but
was at 56.2% of 2019 flight levels (pre-COVID-19). Compared with 2019,
only two segments increased in 2021 and they were All-Cargo (+13.9%) and
Business Aviation (+3.8%). The Mainline (-54.5%), Low-Cost (-53.9%) and
Regional (-47.6%) segments were the most affected, along with the Charter
segment which went down by -20.6% in 2021 (vs 2019).

### Top 20 number of flights by civil aviation aircraft in Europe (ECAC) in 2021

In 2021 there were 301 different civil aircraft types operating IFR
flights in Europe. About 70% of the flights were carried out by the 20
aircraft types listed in @tbl-flights-per-aircraft-type. Please note that the values presented in @tbl-flights-per-aircraft-type focuses on the civil aviation flights (i.e. excluding the military and other categories), resulting in a difference in the total flights as compared with @tbl-flights-per-market-segment and @tbl-ifr-flights-month.

### Daily average of IFR flights, 2016 to 2021

@fig-average-daily-ifr-flights-plot shows the daily average number of IFR flights **EU-wide**
between 2016 and 2021.

## When to use the input?

This input is recommended to be used in situations where an overview of the historical evolution in the number of flights is required, namely grouped according to different criteria.
