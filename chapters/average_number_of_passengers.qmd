## Comment

The Eurostat air transport domain contains national and international intra- and
extra-EU data. This provides air transport data for passengers (in numbers of 
passengers) and for freight and mail (in thousands of tonnes), as well as air
traffic data for airports, airlines, and aircraft. Data are transmitted to Eurostat
by the Member States of the European Union as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland,
and the candidate countries. The air transport data have been calculated using
data collected at airports.

## When to use the input?

This input is suitable to be used in any analysis that requires historical data 
on the number of passengers per flight and/or per movement.
