productivity for the Air Navigation Services Providers (ANSP) in the EUROCONTROL area.

@tbl-atm-cost-effectiveness shows the trends in European system averages for the 
years 2015 through 2021. The ACE benchmarking reports comprise data about and 
analysis of cost-effectiveness and productivity for the ANSPs in EUROCONTROL’s
Member States. The key performance drivers of cost-effectiveness are (i) productivity,
(ii) employment costs and (iii) support costs, comprising costs for non-ATCOs 
in OPS employment, non-staff operating costs, exceptional costs, depreciation,
and capital-related costs

On top of the above values, 2021 key performance drivers of financial
cost-effectiveness for ANSPs are summarised in Figure 2.7 of the source document.[@ATMCostEffectivenessACE2023]
**A wide variation per ANSP can be observed:**

* ATCO productivity ranges from 0.14 to 1.52 (Figure 2.8 of the source document)

* Employment costs per ATCO-hour vary from a minimum of €17 to a maximum of €358 per ATCO-hour (Figure 2.10 of the source document)

* Support cost ratio varies from 0.22 to 1.48 in 2021 (Annex 3, Table 0.1 of the source document)


:::{.callout-note}
The employment costs above refer to gate-to-gate cost (i.e. en-route and terminal 
costs) and are expressed in nominal prices.
