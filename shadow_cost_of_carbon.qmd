# Shadow cost of carbon

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

The shadow cost of carbon is the cost of carbon required to drive the economy to meet the 1.5Â°C global temperature target set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The values have been estimated based on the data provided by the European Investment Bank in their 2021-2025 roadmap. [@eib2020]

The input is an adjustment of the EIB recommended values to reflect the most realistic cost of meeting the [UN Paris agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) to limit global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, ideally 1.5 -- compared to pre-industrial levels. [@ipcc2018] Please note this input does not refer to the traditional 'market price' but to the "shadow cost of carbon", i.e. considering externalities and future policies. The original EIB proposed inputs are expressed in 2016 prices and have been adjusted to 2021 price levels using the values provided in @tbl-inflation-table.

## When to use the input?

This input is recommended for projects where the full socio-economic value of the initiative is studied, particularly involving the environmental assessment.

## Comments

In Economic Analyses the concept of 'shadow price/cost' is often used when working with an abstract commodity or intangible assets. Typically, two elements are reflected in the 'shadow cost':

* The cost of negative externalities such as pollution in this case
* The 'shadow' prices involves the consideration of future policies

Shadow prices are inexact by definition, as they are based on assumptions, but their usefulness resides in that they help to understand the full socio-economic merits of a project. Please note that the shadow cost of carbon does not constitute in any way an optimal value for any policy instrument.
