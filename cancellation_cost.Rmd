## Description

The values refer to cancellation on the day of operation and include the following:

* Service recovery costs, i.e. passenger care and compensation costs (passenger vouchers, drinks, telephone calls, hotels)
* Loss of revenue
* Interlining costs
* Loss of future value, i.e. passenger opportunity costs (individual passenger delay expressed in
value)
* Crew and catering costs
* Passenger compensation for denied boarding and missed connections (estimated on the
application of the Regulation (EC) No 261/2004)
* Luggage delivery costs
* Operational savings (fuel, airport and navigation fees, maintenance, handling outstations, lounge
outstations)


Ground handling costs, e.g. ramp services, passenger services and field operation services, are not included.

## Comments

When a flight is carried out, the airline incurs out-of-pocket expenses (i.e. variable costs) but receives revenues which are 60-100% greater than the out-of-pocket expenses. Cancelling a flight means that the airline forgoes a substantial operating profit. Also, in addition to the loss, costs are incurred for the care and compensation of passengers.

Cancellation costs vary as a function of the time of cancellation, as illustrated below.


Timely cancellation will enable the airline to take the necessary measures to mitigate the cost impact, for example by rebooking passengers on another flight and allocating crew and aircraft to a different destination. The cancellation costs will thus be minimal and more in the region of the incurred opportunity cost and passenger value of time. If the cancellation is nearer the flight time, i.e. on the day of operation (D), the cost of cancellation increases, to cover expenses such as fuel, maintenance and crew and catering.
