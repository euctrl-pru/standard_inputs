# Foreword {.unnumbered}

It looks long time ago that we launched the Standard Inputs for EUROCONTROL Economic Analyses series. Our first edition dates back to 2003 and today we take it a step further, launching it for the first time on an online platform to allow for timely and continuous update of the file, following the pace of changes in the aviation world.

Our first launch counts with a selection of values, complemented with some general information and the remaining inputs will be updated continuously. You can access the previous edition of the remaining values through a link in each of the value sections.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to show our gratitude to the many different colleagues
that have contributed to this endeavour. Trying to name them would be
mission impossible. We would certainly forgot someone and this would be unfair.

We have received valuable remarks and suggestions from all stakeholders
in the aviation value chain. In particular we have benefited from
stakeholders involve in the entire development life cycle, from ideas to
a working system. We strongly believe that this collaboration makes the
Standard Inputs for EUROCONTROL Economic Analyses a robust and
authoritative product.

Thank you all for making us learn every day!

Finally, please allow us to make one only two exceptions.

-   We can only recognise the work of two colleagues in particular --
    Paula and Desir√©e -- under whom the initiative was born and developed
    for the past years.

-   And our patient *code teachers* at PRU - Enrico and Oscar.
