# Foreword {.unnumbered}

The first version of the Standard Inputs for EUROCONTROL Economic Analyses series was launched 20 years ago in 2002. Today we take a new step and are launching the latest edition on an online platform to allow for timely and continuous updates of the values, following the pace of change in the aviation world.

Our first launch includes a selection of six values, complemented with some general information and the remaining inputs will be updated over the coming months. You can access the previous edition for the values that are not yet updated through a link in each of the value sections.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to show our gratitude to the many different colleagues
that have contributed to this endeavour by helping us develop the values and get them online. Trying to name them would be impossible.

We have received valuable remarks and suggestions from all stakeholders
in the aviation value chain. In particular we have benefited from
stakeholders involve in the entire development life cycle, from ideas to
a working system. We strongly believe that this collaboration makes the EUROCONTROL
Standard Inputs for Economic Analyses a robust and
authoritative product.

Thank you all for making us learn every day!
