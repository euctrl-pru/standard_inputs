# Foreword {.unnumbered}

## Acknowledgements

We would like to show our gratitude to the many different colleagues
that have contributed to this endeavour. Trying to name them would be
mission impossible. We would for sure forgot someone and this would be
quite unfair.

We have received valuable remarks and suggestions from all stakeholders
in the aviation value chain. In particular we have benefited from
stakeholders involve in the entire development life cycle, from ideas to
a working system. We strongly believe that this collaboration makes the
Standard Inputs for EUROCONTROL Economic Analyses a robust and
authoritative product.

Thank you all for making us learn every day!

Finally, please allow us to make one only two exceptions.

-   We can only recognise the work of two colleagues in particular --
    Paula and Desir√©e -- under who the initiative was born and developed
    for the past years.

-   And our patient *code teachers* at PRU - Enrico and Oscar.

## About us

We are the ECTTL Business Case team.

Explain further.

## History

It looks long time ago that we launched the Standard Inputs for
EUROCONTROL Economic Analyses series. Our first edition dates back into
XXXX. The document was born as the Business Cases Team own internal need
to have a common reference of economic inputs to use in our multiple ATM
economic analyses.

## This year

For this special edition we will be using an incremental approach. We
are publishing inputs at the time we finished them.

## New

Further focus on work from other EU Aviation public bodies. Notably EC,
SJU, SDM and EIB. Digitalisation. We will be using the advantages of
digitalisation. Will be a live document with more frequent updates. You
will be able to download most of the data we propose for your own
purposes.

## Coming soon

We are working to integrate the newcomers, RPAs. Specific focus on
environmental considerations. Comparison with other equivalent
initiatives, notably FAA and CAA Australia. Inclusion or Rotorcraft. A
fleet projection.

We are happy to receive any comment or suggestion you might have. The
easiest way to reach us is using email.here\@eurocontrol.int.

## Other

Although we cannot foresee when, or even if, the world will return to
what it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided to publish
this new edition of the standard inputs as a valuable source of inputs
for economic and cost-benefit analyses in aviation. The recommended
values are often based on 2019 statistics and data which do not yet take
account of the impact of the pandemic.

For this edition, the focus is on environmental values, a new value for
airports, turn-around time, and the introduction of two values related
to drones. Drones represent a highly complex and fast-moving market,
which makes forecasting more difficult than legacy aviation sectors.
Suggestions for improvement and collaboration are welcome. Please send
them to aviation.intelligence\@eurocontrol.int.

We would like to make a special mention of the launch of the EUROCONTROL
Aviation Intelligence Portal, which provides valuable and up-to-date
information for economic analyses (https://ansperformance.eu/). The
Portal will soon include the standard inputs (2021) and more information
of use for cost-benefit analyses.
