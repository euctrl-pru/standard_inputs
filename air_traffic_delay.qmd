# Air traffic delay

## Definition

Evolution in reported delays taking two perspectives:

1.  The view of airlines and passengers considering all causes of delay

2.  The view of the Network Manager focusing on Air Traffic Flow
    Management delays

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

Below two different views are provided: first, the values recommended
for Airspace Users and Passengers, followed by a zoom-in to the purely
ATFM-related delays.

### All causes of delay

The figure below presents an **overview of all causes of delay**
reported by the airlines in 2020 and 2021. These figures are estimated
by EUROCONTROL Central Office of Delay Analysis (CODA), and they are
calculated based on the comparison of the scheduled and actual flight
timings and can be used in studies that look into the different causes
of flight delay experienced by passengers and airlines.

Europe*[@coda2021]

### ATFM delay

Looking specifically into **ATFM delay**, the figure below shows the
daily traffic and traffic flow delay per flight (en-route and at
airport) for the period 2012-2021. These figures are calculated by the
Network Manager based on the flight plans and include the planned ATFM
delays due to the restrictions that may be applied in the airspace.

The flow management delay constitutes only a fraction of primary delay
from all causes, and around half of all delay is reactionary (i.e.,
delay caused by late arrival of aircraft, crew, passengers or baggage
from previous journeys) rather than primary (i.e., delay other than
reactionary).

## When to use the input?

We recommend using all causes of delay provided by CODA when analysing
the impacts on airlines or on passengers/society (e.g., an airline
upgrading the avionics in their aircraft; airport expansion, etc.). On
the other hand, ATFM delay is recommended to be used when analysing
projects aiming at improving Flow Management.

## Comment

Looking at both figures above, it can be observed that the ATFM delay,
both at the airport and en-route, is higher when looking at the numbers
provided by the airlines rather than that observed by the Network
Manager. This occurs because the delay numbers provided by the Network
Manager account for the so-called planned delay due to restrictions in
the airspace, while the numbers provided by the airlines cover the total
delay they attribute to ATFM, irrespective from the restrictions or any
planned ATFM delays.

Another important point to take into consideration
when analysing the recommended values is the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. Both, the all-causes delay and the ATFM delay were impacted by
the significant reduction in air traffic in 2020 and 2021, resulting
into a strong drop in the total delay duration. Thus, when looking into
these numbers it is equally important to consider the situation prior to
2020. For the All-causes delay this information can be found in the
previous editions of CODA Digest, available in [EUROCONTROL
library](https://www.eurocontrol.int/library/search?f%5B0%5D=product%3A805&f%5B1%5D=product%3A805).
