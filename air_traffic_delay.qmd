# Air traffic delay

## Definition

Evolution in reported delays taking two perspectives:

1.  The view of airlines and passengers considering all causes of delay

2.  The view of the Network Manager focusing on Air Traffic Flow
    Management delays

## EUROCONTROL recommended values

Below two different views are provided: first, the values recommended
for Airspace Users and Passengers, followed by a zoom-in to the purely
ATFM-related delays.

### All causes of delay

The figure below presents an **overview of all causes of delay** reported by the airlines in 2020 and 2021. These figures are estimated by EUROCONTROL Central Office of Delay Analysis (CODA), and they are calculated based on the comparison of the scheduled and actual flight timings and can be used in studies that look into the different causes of flight delay experienced by passengers and airlines.

### ATFM delay

Looking specifically into **ATFM delay**, the figure below shows the daily traffic and traffic flow delay per flight (en-route and at airport) for the period 2012-2021. These figures are calculated by the Network Manager based on the flight plans and include the planned ATFM delays due to the restrictions that may be applied in the airspace.

## Description

The report identified in the source value gives an overview of the delay
situation in the European Civil Aviation Conference area. It has been
prepared by the Central Office for Delay Analysis (CODA), a EUROCONTROL
service. It is based on delay data provided directly by airlines. This
data on all causes of delay is derived by airlines, comparing actual
timings with their published schedules.

Statistics on all causes of delay can be obtained directly from the CODA
Interactive Dashboard (CID) (a request for access is required). This
dashboard aims to provide the user with an enhanced understanding of the
causes of delay to flights, both that relating to air traffic flow
management (ATFM) and non-ATFM-related delay. ATFM delay constitutes
only a fraction of primary delays from all causes, and around half of
all delay is reactionary rather than primary. Analyses within the
dashboard are based on flight-by-flight data provided by airspace users
as well as the Network Manager.
