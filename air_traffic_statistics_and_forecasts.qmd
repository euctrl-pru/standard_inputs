# Air traffic statistics and forecasts {#air-traffic-statistics-and-forecasts}

## EUROCONTROL recommended value

The Statistics and Forecasts (STATFOR) service produces flights and service units forecasts of future network traffic with a view to help planners understand and manage risks, identify bottlenecks and anticipate the needs of airspace users.

## When to use the inputs?

The objective of STATFOR is to provide statistics and forecasts on IFR flight movements and service units in Europe (ECAC) and to monitor and analyse the evolution of the air transport industry.

* Medium-term forecasts (7-year timespan):
  The 7-year forecasts give a comprehensive picture of anticipated
  air traffic development in Europe for the next seven years.
  They combine flight statistics with economic growth and models of
  other industry drivers, including costs, airport capacity,
  passenger numbers, load factors and aircraft size.
  Using high- and low-growth scenarios, they present a likely range
  for growth, to help planners manage risks.
  They are published biannually, in spring and autumn, covering flights,
  en route and terminal service units.

The above graph shows the traffic forecast taking account of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the base scenario, IFR flights are expected to get back to 2019 levels by 2025.


* Long-term forecasts (between 20 and 30 timespan):
  The 2030-year forecasts look at a range of distinct possible scenarios
  for how the air traffic industry might look in 20-30 years’ time.
  This allows a range of ‘what if?’ questions to be explored, for factors
  inside the industry (e.g. the growth of small business jets,
  or of point-to-point traffic) or outside the industry (e.g. the price
  of oil or environmental constraints).
  20-30-year forecasts are usually published every two to three years.
